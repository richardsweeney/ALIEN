HOW TO USE THIS FILE
================================================================================

This file is organized into 5 sections:

  SECTION 1: GM SESSION NOTES
    Key decisions, player setup, session plan context, and GM rulings
    made during prep. Read this first for context.

  SECTION 2: SCENARIO REFERENCE GUIDE
    Structured overview of the setting, NPCs, factions, locations,
    and act-by-act breakdown. Good for quick lookups.

  SECTION 3: CHARACTER SHEETS (ALL 7 PCs)
    Complete stat blocks, talents, gear, buddy/rival relationships
    for all pre-generated player characters.

  SECTION 4: FULL SCENARIO TEXT
    The complete Destroyer of Worlds scenario book (90 pages),
    transcribed via vision reading from image-based PDFs. Contains
    all events (mandatory and optional), location descriptions,
    NPC details, Xenomorph appendix, stat blocks, and maps.

    vision transcription process, but 95%+ is clean and readable.

  SECTION 5: ALIEN RPG STARTER SET RULEBOOK
    The complete core rules from the ALIEN Starter Set (105 pages).
    All mechanics: skills, combat, damage, stress/panic, critical
    injuries, hazards, weapons, gear, armor, vehicles, space combat.

Total size: ~11,000+ lines. This is a large file but Claude Code
can handle it as project knowledge.

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE: KEY GAME MECHANICS
================================================================================

DICE SYSTEM (Year Zero Engine):
  - Roll Base Dice (d6) equal to Attribute + Skill
  - Add Stress Dice (d6) equal to current Stress Level
  - Each 6 = one success. One success needed to succeed.
  - Extra 6s = stunts (bonus effects)
  - Stress Dice: if any show a 1 (facehugger symbol) = Panic Roll
  - Pushing: reroll all non-6 dice, but Stress +1. Cannot push if
    not stressed (some talents override this).

ACTIONS PER ROUND:
  - One SLOW action + one FAST action, OR two FAST actions
  - Slow: attack, first aid, use skill, reload
  - Fast: move one zone, take cover, draw weapon, give order

RANGE BANDS:
  - ENGAGED: right next to you (melee range)
  - SHORT: same zone, a few meters
  - MEDIUM: adjacent zone, ~25m
  - LONG: two zones away
  - EXTREME: three+ zones away

STRESS & PANIC:
  - Stress increases from: pushing rolls, full auto, taking damage,
    seeing terrifying things, crew attacks, android reveals, etc.
  - When any Stress Die shows 1: make Panic Roll (1d6 + Stress Level)
  - Results 1-6 = manageable. 7+ = panic effects (freeze, flee, berserk)
  - Some panic results force nearby PCs to also make Panic Rolls (cascade)
  - Relieving stress: 1 Turn of rest in safe area = -1 Stress
  - Signature item (once per Act) = -1 Stress
  - Naproleve drug = Stress to zero

ARMOR:
  - M3 Personnel Armor: Armor Rating 6
  - When hit, roll dice equal to Armor Rating; each 6 = -1 damage
  - Cover has its own Armor Rating; stacks with worn armor
  - Common cover: shrubbery 2, furniture 3, door 4, bulkhead 5-6

COMBAT STUNTS (extra 6s beyond first):
  Close Combat: +1 damage, swap initiative, disarm, knockdown, grapple
  Ranged Combat: +1 damage, pin down (Panic Roll), swap init, disarm, knockdown

FULL AUTO: +2 to roll, Stress +1 immediately, extra 6s can hit secondary
  targets within SHORT range of primary.

KEY TALENTS IN PLAY:
  - Overkill (Hammer, Mason): reroll 6s on ranged attacks for +1 dmg each
  - Field Commander (Silva): push Command for free, no stress gain
  - Past the Limit (Silva, Iona): delay first Panic Roll by one trigger
  - Field Surgeon (Chaplain): +2 to Medical Aid for critical injuries
  - Bodyguard (Chaplain): take hits for buddy at ENGAGED range
  - Nerves of Steel (Mason): max +1 Stress per event
  - Menacing (Hammer): +2 to intimidation
  - Weapon Specialist RPG (Dante): +1 damage with M5 RPG
  - Banter (Dante, Iona): push Empathy rolls for free

SECTION 1: GM SESSION NOTES & DECISIONS
################################################################################

PLAYER SETUP:
  - 5 players + 1 Game Mother
  - Player Characters: Silva, Dante, Hammer, Mason, Chaplain
  - GM NPCs: Iona and Zmijewski (background, follow the squad,
    don't make decisions — available as dramatic casualties)
  - Silva is a PLAYER character, not GM-controlled. This is deliberate:
    players should be fully autonomous. The GM uses Colonel Meyers
    (via radio), environmental pressure, and Story Cards to drive
    the narrative instead of an NPC captain giving orders.

GM VOICE / NARRATIVE STEERING:
  - Primary GM mouthpiece: Colonel Meyers over radio comms
  - Secondary: Sergeant Botos (during war game tutorial only)
  - Environmental pressure (explosions, alarms, collapsing structures)
    replaces NPC direction-giving
  - Story Cards and Personal Agendas create internal party conflict
  - Never use Iona/Zmijewski to steer — they follow, they don't lead

SESSION 1 STRUCTURE:
  Part 1: Combat Tutorial "War Game" (~45 min)
    - Killhouse training exercise at Fort Nebraska
    - 5 zones: Entry, Firing Range, Cover Drill, Melee Pit, Panic Room
    - Round 1: Initiative, movement, basic shooting
    - Round 2: Full auto, cover, ammo/reload, Stress Dice intro
    - Round 3: Close combat, blocking, grappling, retreat
    - Round 4: Stress +2, shooting in dark, Panic Rolls, Command to recover
    - No real consequences — training exercise only

  Part 2: Act I — Destruction
    - Scene 1: Briefing from Colonel Meyers
    - Scene 2: APC convoy to colony (character introductions)
    - Scene 3: Arrival at colony (meet Marshal Hyams, colonists)
    - Scene 4: Inciting incident (insurgent attack / UPP involvement)
    - End: Evaluate Personal Agendas, hand out Act II agendas

KEY HIDDEN PLOT POINTS (GM EYES ONLY):
  - Dante carries a Chestburster embryo (births in Act III)
  - Chaplain is a synthetic controlled by Jaell via A.P.O.L.L.O.
  - "Restart" event in Act II frees Chaplain from Jaell's control
  - Hammer's X-Stim addiction: must take one every Shift or Stress +1,
    cannot relieve stress without the drug
  - The colony was hit by a mutagenic black goo pathogen
  - Anathema stages: Afflicted → Febrile → Freak → Terminal
  - Fort Nebraska is overrun by Xenomorphs by Act III
  - The climber (space elevator car) is the only escape route

---

## FACTIONS

### 1. United Americas / USCMC (Colonial Marines)
- Skeleton crew of military personnel
- Barely holding the colony together on the eve of war
- Fort Nebraska serves as staging ground for fleet to retake 61 Cygni

### 2. Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP)
- Cold War-style rival power
- Annexed 61 Cygni system one week before scenario starts
- Planning invasion of Ariarcus
- Better equipped than insurgents: armored vehicles, combat androids, dropships

### 3. Ariarcus Insurgency
- Disgruntled colonists who sought UPP aid
- Attack oil fields (declared terrorism by Colonial Administration)
- Regular humans — not a major combat threat to trained Marines
- Key NPCs: Imre Botos, Ivan Stolls

### 4. Weyland-Yutani
- Represented by Mallory Eckford
- Running secret Project Life Force bioweapons program
- Want xenobiological samples preserved at all costs

### 5. Colonists
- ~2,200 disillusioned civilians
- Mix of oil workers, families, and UPP sympathizers
- Become prisoners of UPP in Act 2; dead by Act 3

### 6. The Engineers (Act 2/3 Arrival)
- Mysterious ship arrives
- EMPs everyone's electronics
- Bombards colony with Black Goo
- Not a faction players interact with directly

---

## SCENARIO STRUCTURE: THREE ACTS

### ACT 1 — THE MANHUNT

**Premise:** Charlie Team deploys into Ariarcus colony to hunt down four AWOL marines and recover stolen classified assets.

**Key Events & Details:**
- PCs travel through colony visiting key locations
- Random colony encounter tables (Hangar Incidents table, etc.)
- Finding informants, dealing with insurgent terrorists, uncovering clues about AWOLs
- PCs can return to base for resupply or request dropship for aerial assault
- Final event: assault on insurgent stronghold/compound
- Can be long or short depending on player pace

**Main Adversaries:** Insurgents (regular humans, minor threat to trained Marines); potentially a single xenomorph loose in colony

**Pacing Notes:**
- Act 1 is tough to run, especially for inexperienced GMs
- Many moving parts; lots of information players need early for later acts to make sense
- Not much mandatory combat apart from the end

**Act 1 Ends:** When players resolve the insurgent compound situation

---

### ACT 2 — THE INVASION

**Premise:** Full-scale war erupts as the UPP invades Ariarcus. PCs must fight their way back to Fort Nebraska.

**Key Events & Details:**
- UPP launches full invasion of Ariarcus
- Colonists at spaceport become prisoners of UPP
- PCs may still need to track down remaining AWOLs
- UPP soldiers are better equipped: armored vehicles, combat androids, dropships
- Can be stretched with events, roleplay, and combat

**Main Adversaries:** UPP military forces

**The Catastrophic Turning Point:**
- A mysterious Engineer ship arrives
- Blasts everyone's electronics with an EMP
- Bombards the main colony with Black Goo (Accelerant/Pathogen from Prometheus)
- Wipes out large portions of colony
- "The Black Death sequence" — considered one of the most dramatic moments in a published RPG

**Act 2 Ends:** With the Engineer ship's bombardment of the colony

---

### ACT 3 — ESCAPE FROM FORT NEBRASKA

**Premise:** Everything has gone catastrophically wrong. Fort Nebraska is overrun. PCs must survive and escape via the space elevator.

**Key Events & Details:**
- Fort Nebraska is "basically a Hive" by now
- Colonists at the spaceport are dead
- PCs must navigate:
  - Haywire sentry guns
  - Stalking xenomorphs (full hive + Queen)
  - Fallen debris
  - Offline central computer (A.P.O.L.L.O.)
  - Chestburster biological clocks
  - Rogue synthetics
  - Desperate refugees
  - Treacherous superior officers
- **Key Objectives:**
  1. Sneak inside Fort Nebraska
  2. Restart the reactor
  3. Access A.P.O.L.L.O. to learn what happened
  4. Escape the planet via the space elevator
- May need to decide whether to overload the nuclear reactor to destroy the colony
- Environmental hazards: "oil-eater" bacteria and radiation (very punishing until PCs find hazmat suits)
- Black Goo abominations roaming the colony exterior

**Main Adversaries:**
- Full xenomorph hive with Queen (14 Armor)
- "Charger" — gigantic tank-like special xenomorph (potential "final boss")
- Black Goo Anathema/Abominations
- Colonel Meyers (trying to cover up Project Life Force)
- Jaell (if not deactivated)

**Pacing Notes:**
- Potential to be very long with events and random encounters
- Avoid doing Act 3 in a single session
- This is the survival-horror climax

---

## GM ADVICE & TIPS

### Pacing
- Schedule 12–14+ hours total game time
- Act 1: Can be short or long depending on player speed to compound
- Act 2: Stretch with events, roleplay, combat
- Act 3: Do NOT run in a single session; schedule across two sessions
- Could get 7+ sessions if playing every event and location

### Running Act 1 (Hardest to GM)
- Tough for inexperienced GMs — lots of moving parts
- Many things players need to learn early for later acts
- Not much mandatory combat (until compound at end)
- Let players explore at their pace; use random encounter tables

### Trimming Content
- The adventure has "too much of everything" by most accounts
- Consider choosing 3 factions/agendas to focus on; set others aside
- Tone down number and quality of opposition
- Use abominations and xenomorphs more sparingly in Acts 1-2
- Focus on UPP sympathizers and their plots for Acts 1-2
- A full Queen for finale may be overkill for depleted groups; consider using a Drone or Scout instead

### Character Selection
- Priority picks: Silva (as NPC), Dante, Chaplain, Mason
- For 3 players: each player runs main character + secondary character (no Agenda, less RP)
- Leftover PCs ride in APC as backup NPCs

### Queen Combat
- 14 armor seems tough but falls quickly to RPGs, sniper rifles, SmartGuns
- Marines with Overkill talent + stress + armor-piercing weapons can one-shot Stage IV xenos
- Consider bumping Queen stats depending on survivors

### Alien Encounter Theming
- Choosing fewer alien types focuses the tone
- Lone xenomorph only = tense *Alien* hunt
- Full hive = *Aliens* action
- Black Goo abominations = *Prometheus* cosmic horror
- All three = escalating genre-shift (as written)

- Running on battery reserve (asleep)
- Must restore reactor on Sublevel 02, THEN reboot here (1 Turn)

4. **Brute force:** Not recommended

### The Queen Fight
- PCs must either clear the cargo bay or lock themselves in with the Queen during ascent
- Killing Xenomorphs in climber is dangerous — acid eats through non-resin-coated areas
- Queen releases another Ovomorph each Turn starting when PCs see her
- PCs need MOBILITY roll each Round to stay undetected; first failure = all Xenos go active

### Leaving the Moon (Endgame)
- After 1 Shift of travel: UPP destroyer Trakhni Menya crashes into tether
- Climber stuck at speed; will smash into wreck
- Fixing brakes takes 1 Shift (not enough time)
- PCs must find EEV (Emergency Escape Vehicle) or other solution
- Only one fewer Mk.35 Pressure Suit than there are human PCs — someone gets left out
- Final betrayals, chestburster pops, etc. happen here

---

## SCORCHED MOON PROTOCOL

- Colonel Meyers has poisoned Ariarcus petroleum deposits with voracious oil-eating bacteria
- Bacteria rapidly consumes oil supply, causing unstable voids beneath colony
- Results in: sinkholes, cave-ins, structural collapses
- Oil converted to sparkling carbon silt waste
- **Carbon Silt Exposure:** STRESS LEVEL +1; without breathing apparatus = suffocation (STAMINA roll each Turn); makeshift mask gives +2 to roll
- Every Turn: roll Stress Die for each piece of gear exposed to silt — on facehugger, item clogged/useless (fix with 1 Turn + HEAVY MACHINERY)

[DESTROYER OF WORLDS]

"Those I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER

The xenos are a nightmare. The objectives clear—back down Hadaen colonists, close off all avenues of escape, and ensure that even a handful of fugitives make a prison-escape beat full of hatties and get it done in the eye of morning your mother's funeral.

But what it is that these bastards achieved are the kill it uses is not another xanatos gambit but some sort of Pyrrhic victory combined with enough sheer existential terror to send any reasonable person running.

Of course, one there's an invasion fleet breaching, and there's something being systematically destroyed in an arc across the sector with added late-night zips you're pretty sure it isn't aliens.

GAME MASTERS' NOTES ONLY

This scene teases a reality for the GM: to be aware of what might happen, the characters will encounter in this campaign. There's a full set of story cards. The information contained in this box has been given to avoid spoilers - read only if absolutely necessary. The cards are numbered and keyed with additional context on page XX in the Starter Set rules for more on expanding Story Packs. Don't reveal the actual text of these scenario notes to your players until the end of the scenario.


--- PAGE 4 ---

[INTRODUCTION]

CHARACTERS

This scenario comes with pre-generated characters designed for a four-person Colonial Marine squad plus a two-person command element. The squad is led by a Lieutenant and includes a Specialist and Private. Gunnery-soldiers are stationed on the bridge, a specialized team of Specialist and Private. Located on the Distant Administrator/Union of Progressive Peoples Station, a starport complex in the Outer Rim section of the galaxy, the PCs are part of a Hadean colonial marine forces who are sent out into a hostile location to re-establish control of a human colony and investigate specific events that have taken place in a settlement filled with political and colonial intrigue.

CHARACTER SHEETS: Printable character sheets for these PCs can be found in this book.

PERSONAL AGENDAS

Each player receives their Personal Agenda for each of the three Acts of the scenario. These Agendas are personal to you, and the Agenda at the end of this Act should remain secret with the other players and the GM until the end of Act II.

EVALUATING AGENDAS: At the end of the scenario, you can discuss and evaluate them individually. If you feel a player has actively worked toward their PC's Agenda during play, that player gets to make a significant personal twist on their Personal Agenda. Use page 28 in the Starter Set rules for more on expanding Story Packs. Don't reveal the actual text of these scenario notes to your players until the end of the scenario.

STORY CARDS

Destroyer of Worlds introduces a new element to scenarios for the ALIEN RPG. Rather than having each player an Agenda, but is handed out to a player when a specific event in the scenario occurs. In that way, a player is not allowed to share the information on the Story Card, with the other players—in effect, the Story Card becomes a new Personal Agenda, but is handed out to a player at a time when a player has introduced the context of their Story Card into the game in a meaningful way. Point in addition to any Story Point gained from following their Personal Agenda.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

SCENARIO OVERVIEW

All party systems drift into dormancy. Derelict Station, where PCs have been assembled on an off-ship moon about to break out in isolation. Colonial Marine forces respond to a distress call from the moon, as Fort Hadeson soldiers still report they're detecting an Alien Hive at Location One, and a mysterious signal coming from a bunker deep beneath. The station is being destroyed at an ever-accelerating rate and something else is off. In Blood Worm's quarters, the marines begin to smell the peculiarities. The results were mixed at best.

Later, the marines discover one of the original colony's survivors who now becomes one of the Hadean insurgent compound.

ACT I: The UPP mission begins just as the PCs achieve their objective. The colony quickly becomes an active warzone. Ordered to return to the landing zone and regroup, the now locked-down Facility and colonial marine forces alike, and teams from the moon attempt a new maneuver...

ACT II: The PCs realize they must break into the tower military base use for the space carrier. What they weren't locked down for—combat ant was to break through threats and go all. Facing overwhelming odds they now have to make their way through the inner core of the Command Center to reach the objective.

ACT III: As the PCs climb to orbit, they discover the sunken colony city. After an ancient discovery on the planet itself, they have an escape craft floating among the orbital debris field and get the lock out of space before...

# THE KRUGER 60 SYSTEM

Located within the Outer Veil, Kruger 60 and its Cygnus are two colonial systems located very close to the Janus Corridor on an old trade route called the Habanneth Run. These settlements fall into UPP territory. The Kruger 60 system has hosted a few attempts at settlement in the past, with the British-led American Allied Command (UAAC) and the Colonial Network overseeing what little infrastructure was established. This severe archetypum stretches throughout the colonies has led the United Americas, the Three World Empire, and the Weyland-Yutani Corporation with little of crude oil.

These Old Wars have created severe border tensions. Stretched too thin, the UAAC and the Colonial Network maintain a tense peace, rationing supplies and the mega-corporations' mis-treatment of the working class soldiers trying to keep the peace. The resource pool UPP is poised to take advantage of this development. Weapons smugglers and insurgent G1 Cyprus, annexing the colony on LV-038 in the process. Allied Command seeks a task force to protect UPP interests. The nearest system, Kruger 60—and the moon by far—is an excellent place to be next.

# DESTROYER OF WORLDS

## KRUGER 60 AEM (ARIARCUS)

Originally colonized in 2127 by a band of independent miners, the colony received orbital support once it became clear the moon had been classified as a rich deposit of rare minerals. When the colony swung in the system in 2150s, it was growing lean and vast operational. Soon, each colonist owned a piece of Arizona, the Weyland Corp. In 2200 an exploratory facility was constructed. They incorporated as the Kruger Oil Corp. and continued to expand. The corporation was granted colonial status in 2200.

The colony had a population of 501 and minimal military presence until a security audit in an orbiting Lorax Syntech of military module. Colonial forces were so concerned by something in the archeological records that they thought the facility required redesigning. Ariarcus became a fairly-as colony of hard-working people who worked hard for their families, most of the majority shareholders won't consent to simply make IA money and started calling their colony the United Star Protectorate. The attraction of federal investigators.

**STAR FORT NEBRASKA:** The most permanent and well-maintained of the settlement's strategic outposts. Fortified and defended with railguns. A permanent USCMC presence guard on Ariarcus. The

Other installations on Ariarcus and all tank vents were converted into Star Fort Nebraska.

This was used to create emergency shelters, and the economy of the colony has changed. With most of the colonists and supplies headed north, they had not had communications could start again elsewhere. Some who stayed wandered from former contacts, looking free lines with sympathetic merchant captains. A few found work for the military, only a token number of jobs available. Some are unemployed and others hungry.

**DEVOLUTION:** As supporting the new became even thinner than before, resentment and rage found new ways to support themselves and their families. They began an insurgency movement. The first attempted coup took place in 2289 and involved Colonial Administration and settlers' uprising. As their emergency increased, Colonial Administration began their acts of random destruction.

**CURRENT EVENTS:** The 300 VF combat mission took the colonists by force of arms, nearly 85% of the colony's military was destroyed in rioting. With most of the colonists remaining, most of the colonists are UPP loyalists, while the rest are just desperate to keep. This scenario would be great starting place the area they had been trapped in for about. For more information about the military, Ariarcus military complex and some 500 colonists have camped at the spaceport—awaiting a transport to leave this hellhole. They're sleeping in their homes, either too fearful or too stubborn to leave. Still others have taken to forming outlaw groups outside the military base, ranging from "GO HOMES" demands to "THROW UPP LOYALISTS OUT."

# THE KRUGER 60 SYSTEM

### HOW IS THE WEATHER?

Ariarcus is cool with heavy arctic conditions and near-eternal polar night, and it hovers in the -23° to 0°C range (see Freezing, page 107 in the alien colony's cold skills). The PCs should be on the first they keep their gloves on, and their cold weather gear will be the best armor weapon on its surface.

## FORT NEBRASKA

The below information is common knowledge to the USCMC and almost any official. You may assign it to your players if they ask, feel free to offer the information.

The Star Fort Nebraska is a rising counterweight station with a further-constructed perimeter. The two platform started off as an old refinery module, but several modifications were left in a state of disrepair. The smelting, refining pipeline, desalination, and waste management facilities was an enormous infrastructure improvement. To replace them with fresh reinforce. Counterweight orbital space systems, ground-to-space transport systems, and missile pods about Cornerstone Heights. Homestead AIR supply materials inbound from the outside and maintain the military module.

**A-SPACE C.E.N.:** An advanced ground-to-space transportation system, GSAT, has been installed. A cable bridge was built to travel along the gravity well to allow for the transfer of supplies and personnel from the surface. A series of locks allow for the direct transfer of crude oil directly to the refinery space.

**CYLINDERS:** The space simulator's tank were originally designed for fuels supplies and work crews to and from the surface for loading freight-outs. Within the military docks was cylinders

were refined to carry troops, nuclear weapons inside navigation.

**GROUND FORT:** Conceived to protect the moon's surface and maintain orbit uplifted for from the refinery. The goal of refining of the colony's defunct and dismantled dump compount is processing facility's added surfed-to-orbit processing and other facilities weapons cache with access to the base's subterrane. The colony's power supply came from deep within the subterrane station compound, a logistics company and two rifle companies.

**RESTRICTED FORCES:** While Fort Nebraska's standing complement is 2,400 troops, there are currently only about 1,200 men and women about the same manned. Two fullswitching carrier frigates remain to patrol Kruger 60 while the armored fleet float for LV-038.

**REMAINING FORCES:** While Fort Nebraska's standing complement is 2,400 troops, there are currently only about 1,200 men and women about the same manned. Two fullswitching carrier frigates remain to patrol Kruger 60 while the armored fleet float for LV-038.

# THE SITUATION

## WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

Aware of Weyland-Yutani's goals to weaponize alien creatures, rival PMCs have come together as a company and initiated un-sanctioned work on a biomechanics program utilizing Xenomorph XV121 technology. Together, they've activated experimental facilities both on LV-038 and beneath Fort Nebraska on Ariarcus.

Commanding Officer Colonel Myers, and a Very-high-up official of the Company's Project Life Force lab been going over. They have even engaged to the point of utilizing a new set of combat protocols. Already deployed by some kind of AG-396SK IJ-10 (see Creature of the Gods) as a counteragent to Xenomorph implantation, in some

cases, the clean arrested the development of the virus, prolonging host's awareness. However, certain elements—mutation in the host, the parasite, or both. As the battle over the Cycad IJ system and conflicts evolve into multiple factions available forces in the fight, beating America allied forces to the potential hosts. Those conflicts have led to some battles and civilian deaths. Little did they know that at the extreme end of the equation lay the IJ-038 Project—something they thought happened, but there are hushed whispers everywhere of an unknown being on LV-038.

An android model with zero values of Atlantics with voracious acid-eating bacteria, an will consume the moon's oil reserves. As the clock to a different chemical and biological virus to prevent the resources—forming unstable voids beneath the colony. Boreholes, crevices, and structural collapses are all serious concerns.

WEYLAND-YUTANI

Enter, of course, Weyland-Yutani—in the form of Ms. Mallory Claridge. Claridge is a career Weyland-Yutani troubleshooter, and one hell of a value—she's seen the proof that the aliens can be weaponized. She knows that freeing such a threat on Company enemies would be brilliant, strategically. She and her team of Dust Catchers have hacked into the network ARES uses to reach its AI colonists. They will move straight to the foundry. Once the AWOLS are here, she will freeze them and smuggle them off with the rest of her WY cargo.

Of course, the local Insurgents are tracking this when they can. They haven't moved against her yet because they're keen to welcome the UPP into Arterus with a gift of alien xenomorphs. After the debacle of the synthetic incident at Hadley's Hope, the Government on distant Earth has ordered its people to clean out the Colonies and restore order. The other AWOLS got wind of this, and realize comes looking for the hardware, the Insurgents decide they too just might make a good offering to the UPP.

WHERE THE AWOLS ARE

WRIGHT: Wright left Condition with the others taking her shift's to the Obsidian bar. She and Wright found Obsidian Strain; RESS: Passe stayed Strain—they didn't know who they have.

WÓJCIK: After leaving San Riccos, Wójcik was assaulted. After sitting atop same locker, Wójcik was hoisted up at the lifeboat she's boon nowhere to be found. She's likely assimilating a Chestburster, or else she's lost her job she's quite able to, or she's transferred to the UPP's dirty laundry corps. Somewhere along her alien parasite and herself into one being. When the PCs get to her, she is belching of her, bearing the impregnated stage of a brand- new monster.

[THE SITUATION header]

WHAT'S THE STORY, MOTHER?

You're stranded on the icy fringes of Arterus in the nebulas. Arterus is also a hotbed of desperate people. Desperate situations grow out of United Americas, the Three World Empire, and other faction-hunting concerns. Desperate has of every kind of strife in the frozen reaches of Arterus.

With the UPP massing in its Kasper 89 nest, the United Americas has deployed the PCs to to losses and excavate the colony—but as of hold Arterus together. The Government the telling, the paperwork is bottlenecked by of United Americas called Command (UACC) and the bureaucratic red tape and argument. With United Nations also take a diplomatic most of the serious personnel are rarely 2200 approach and let an old-timer on United call, only the colony is under siege. Now, Major Hartfield from the Interspace Transport Service, has ordered Artemis—and a few special command as a pretext and insurgents cause trouble persons teams to go in.

The local United Artemis reign: by refusing location on the frozen moon while the colonial governments on the frozen moon are occupied with their governments and operations and security—reaching into orbit mars far removed from any a colony. It is one of the local United Artemis reign by refusing location on the frozen moon. At least subhead 250,000 colonists on Artemis—the colonial has been shadowed by the moon government. Within the colony is a United Technologies a lot of old money and power, but about 2,000 have shadowed the moon government. Within the colony is United Technologies controlling most of the colony at the year more than a ghost town.

One week ago, the Derelict of Perpetual-class Freighter Draconis returned. It found the Obsidian bar, and the Insurgents killed the AWOLS. There are also a handful of other people who have the AWOLS until the Insurgents took them back in Cyprus, using the First Hadean-class refueling station in the Kasper 80 system as a staging ground. That's where you are.

The Chestbursters were returned in Captain Grime and Major Hartfield's quarters were raided from your companies liaison. The Obsidian bar is only at the fort on the visible colony moon Artemus. One of the largest products.

In the cabins, Artemus is also a hotbed of desperate people. With the UPP massing in its Kasper 80 nest, the United Americas has deployed the PCs, the Insurgents are dashing to get the AWOLs and the UPP. In this chaotic environment, the Insurgents decide they too just might make a good offering to the UPP, Heroes' alien hand is deeply resting on their future. Everything else about them is unconfirmed.

# MOONSIDE LOCATIONS

## OVERVIEW
Radiating out from the control fort, the Arcanus colony sprawls over 16 kilometers. Split into four districts, the settlement houses roughly 3,000 people in various outposts, together and refined into living accommodations, recreation facilities and industrial structures with streets running between them.

**MAPS**: You'll find an overview of Arcanus on the facing page of this book. Within it there are also detailed maps of the locations listed here are also included in the set—allow the players these maps when you direct their characters to new area.

## DISTRICT SOUTH

Sometimes called Downtown, District South includes the spaceport, bar, and residences.

### COLONY SPACEPORT

Protected by a five-meter storm wall to the south, the colony's spaceport lies on the edge of the District South. Security forces mill about the front area. While the slick are simply above a maintenance hangar for the colony's support ships.

# DOWNTOWN

These buildings have second story establishments with dark units. Chipped up columns provide underneath at ground level.

**THE GOLD RUSH**: A large bar has main with-ing-yo with a red monster moon at its center moves like a red, with the country's only main bar counter and interior brick walls of red-muted leather to find it is downtown, by Act II it is decimated.

**THE ARCADE**: A large recreational facility with pool tables, video games, and old computer screens mixed with the alternating neon symbol and color. Codes from behind general public Colonists "here-and-there dancers sway rhythmically on the "wet floor". At any point, any security floor for a bout two hours, the place quickly dances who revolves celebrating the end of this world.

**THE INFIRMARY**: Later by the room is a few all stations below. The infirmary has, medicines. They can work as a stage. Nine dancers, four of which show dance, and around the stage and pin.

**THE CROWD**: As the marines move through the colony down the door way to quickly ire before the marines open fire at the crowd. Slay out unchecked, they all break to the entrance or about through passages. See page 38: "You manage-Fu" uses the board itself you step to see.

**THE TUSK**: The drunk-store captain of the SWE Freighter USS Magus. Isn't a thick here while her ship awaits repairs (see Hangar 02 on page 23). Pete's a competent captain but his crew has the needs to get off the ground are stuck in what looks to be a miscommunication of traffic. If she's given the order to "stand by" until someone gets her crew back on her crew have had lots of requests to get people off-world, and it's a good playplay who's message of 'Wings' is the spaceship she will see.

**PETE CALLOWAY**: She is distracted for a few details. She has a hidden boot of illegal papers in a leather flask of whiskey, and a pack of Imperials. Normally she's found in the Arcade at the head of the bar. If it shows an image of her with a tattoo across her spine. "One doesn't ever know what Pete's got to offer.

**THE MARINES**: There are a dorm-stationary barracks located up the street and floor. There are always few concerned colonists, but if them need drinking or fighting the event without any bar. Pete's got a flat 54 bottle per cortain event.

**PETE**: Pete is an S-class addict with a hidden Exp-433 in a deep of illegally sold joy on his belt. Pete shows a wrist computer that requires a hard (<2) concrete roll to open—or PS3900 in cold coins to $500 (bribe or blackmail a system clock).

The records show [illegible] and on his monthly log will identify any [illegible] law may discover. For a full check back with the Marshal station, they discover the deputies have already skipped town for questioning.

**ARTIFICIAL MANAGEMENT**

One of the station's greatest assets was also its biggest liability. The now-destroyed Weyland-Yutani servers and computers (Section 11.4 in the previous source book) were the hub of all Station operations. The network, along with all the data it held and the control systems (hacking skills, logic and access) created massive vulnerability. Sections were capable of being locked down or otherwise damaged, and those locked would need to be worked around.

**DESTROYER OF WORLDS**

**DISTRICT EAST**

A good neighborhood, the dock and the cops can be found here.

**MARSHAL STATION**

*Small office of the Colonial Marshals Station is unfortunately empty at the time. Currently, Marshal Hyams, KT, is in charge. For twenty years he has tried to maintain law and order for just about 60 people who live here.*

■ ACT II of II, the station is destroyed, but sections in the Docs (looking to find) will reveal information about an attack from the Drone's cocoon sack, and two dead UPPO soldiers. There is also a third detail Hyams here to find about Drone's weapons.

■ DETENTION: The frazzled receptionist Olga is struggling with reports and documents, looking for everything. She remembers that one came from District South up on Marcher, and the other are in ADMINISTRATION. She doesn't remember that one came from this location.

■ BULLPEN: In this open white-painted room where Marshall Hyams and his deputies have access to files, the CDs return Facilities, have power station access. Finding what will tell them that a deputy is currently questioning a supposed intruder in the interrogation [illegible]. The Bullpen monitor a multi-camera security feed (serving comms, Getting access to these requires another MANIPULATION roll on HYAMS. A satellite backup can zoom in on a Deputy's location. The equipment feeds are black—they were vandalized or suffered

**INTERROGATION ROOM:** Deputy Mike Dodd is currently recording statements from a suspicious character here. The interrogation room is a heathorn and is consistently breaching his chest and hands (see header). His visitor (in a broken-up shape) is chained to the chair - in his notes (out). With a successful MANIPULATION roll, staph will allow Intercept. Welds can see the Drogue, but they can see nothing. His chair has been turned toward this wall. He does not know where the introgents took the sack, and why there might be a connection with them. Mike, down the hall and to the UPP at the Old Refinery.

■ EVIDENCE: This is sealed. The deputy left section are the cold data of the sack. Laying on the cot is the much dark. Maybe those blood spots are from an accident. The room to the right is covered in dried blood, but the ICS need to stay on observation call to notice. When turned over, a gashing wound in the back, likely been chewed off and there is a formal report in the cells at the Old Refinery.

■ HIDE the HOLDING AREA in the shadows above the structure has evidence. It's located behind a locked [illegible] in this area. The room is accessed via Chestburster's cocoon. His one notices until a door is jammed shut on someone they're searching. They get past it and find something else in there—a Drone Xenomorph (page 24). It turns from the cocoon and tries to hug someone with its tail [illegible] the creature, the ICS Draw initiative.

**CALL I**: Anyone in the jail cell destroying human and die sack area will feel something wrong. The sounds of creatures, the lack of animals, and the only feel are very weak and insect-like.

**THE DOCKS**: Day portside characters ever are they, going and going and doing with the old walls. A structure made of stone and steel, and filled with power. There are some supplies, newer oil and acid escape onto.

A bank of nine portable ATVs (solar 85) are available at the docking doors. Any military key tier will release one.

**UPPO SENSOR**: There might be cameras in the background clicking sounds are very noticeable, clicking and alarms going around the place and correct old [illegible] from "electrical cloaking" in this room. There's a possible call [illegible] the north in the vicinity of the Oil Fields and Old Refinery.

**COLONY RECORDS**: There's a small records office at the starboard—see Media (see pg. [illegible]) in the main cafeteria. Maybe Bullpen can access its code from [illegible] areas. A small room on page 26). By coordinates here could be there. What was [illegible] to Artemus [illegible].

**SAN ROCCO MEDICAL FACILITY**

A small hospital, San Rocco currently has one doctor, two medics, and a medician on duty. Two Emergency Medical Teams are out on calls. In the last few hours the team has made multiple trips in and out of the blocks are shattered. The Examination bay is intact, but the oxygen [illegible] more powerful than the normal capacity. Fresh Anesthesia (page 65).

**INFECTION SAMPLE**: The head sack is marked with a card, the comms beeping steadily. Frazzled system Duchess (from the old one night drive) about a small operation. The [illegible] members among someone remaining [Visibility] and Crystalline growth. There's no names on the desk, and the [illegible] set to try to come see. The Doctor Lavon was the attending physician this morning, so he might know more about it. For information on the Doctor, see the page [illegible].

**RECOVERY 03**: Only one of two beds here is occupied, by an elderly patient in a coma. A machine keeps her breath and monitors her vitals.

RECOVERY 02: The PCs are greeted by the stealthy tone of a flatline—punctuated by a herd alarm. They see injured medical personnel scattered across a pristine surgical theater. Ferdinand with a gauntlet wound—along with a terrifying manifest in hand. The forth ceiling appears to be caved in. A medbot screams about to go into surgery with Carvathe and has administered his restraint. The PC can investigate the medical staff and interrogate Ferdinand.

Ferdinand will tense up when the PCs enter the room. He's full strength with a wound across his chest and he thinks the marines are here for him. He will try and attack the PCs as if they're a hostage. If restrained or calmed, Ferdinand will reveal that he was shot by someone outside, and the AWOLs are building her in the insurgent basement and her ship system for her.

RECOVERY 03: Each of these rooms has an old life or old services.

MEDICAL STORES: Any reasonable drug, city available on the life can be easily found. The doctor's medicine cabinet and must be bypassed with a code level.

MEDBAY: [illegible] A lab with vero surgeons. These day of natural causes and recovered in get-tering still—killed in a gunstruck accident. Cause of deaths: all speculation.

EXAMINATION/SURGICAL BAYS: Rocco has four such bays. Each has a computer terminal and an operating table. Only one Autopsy. Only Bot Q4 is active. The door here is locked, but what's going on inside the sterile bay can be seen through the viewing glass wall. A sedated man is a hospital gown lies in the Alectron—[illegible] Dr Levon

When Levin sees the PCs, he will warn them away or try to drop like them. PCs seem threatening. he will use chemical spray to incapacitate them. It it's an empty threat, he will be disturbed and holding each other. If the PCs seem aggressive, [illegible] got a hit to say. The PCs can talk him down with the promise that he can be trusted more "Destiny's Prophets." While the PCs get busy talking to the doctor, the Insurgent contact will wake up. He will babble and start muttering about how [illegible] [illegible] is in and out a bunch of weird code. The appropriate moment he will cause hysterical and head banging. Doctors have hit him but [illegible] literally pull the Cheshire has hit, sitting himself in the life like a weird. His ramblings will ramble within one Turn (whichever you feel it is dramatically appropriate).

ACT II: If the PCs come home in Act II, the place is either a distracted wreck for Surgical Roy. On the way in they can see blast marks on the wall and the dead light through the viewing glass they can Carvathe's disemboweled body lying under Dr Levon overseeing a the corner, but it takes an unsatisfaction on the Insurgent. When they see the PCs she snaps. Her sidearm becomes active and she stalk them. If they see it, it will attack the dossession glass to block her, giving her enough time to escape the initiative.

DOCTOR'S PERSONAL: If the PCs got become ideas to joke, he can create their beliefs out—oh him. A mender place has been installed where in the room—[illegible] after the brand hand. The [illegible] can find items related to his person of his life. The results are left in the dorm in without depending basic trains some details about the incident in the record here.

DISTRICT NORTH

In addition to it manifesting of mostly disassessed rules household, District North also contains its fields and the oil refinery.

OIL FIELDS

This remote stretch of mile-dosed land is composed of a network of rusted metal tubes, pipes massive mobile drilling rigs and storage tanks. With the rigs at various states, the burned rust. There's blood on the floor.

OLD REFINERY

Closed down since the turn of the century, this grounds heavily had massive cold all directions. It consists of an administrative unit, waste storage, and more. The central complex houses of all the equipment. The administration building has the offices and storage. The office is a hollow shell. These and very direction all the refinery.

OFFICE: Someone has started some barrel fires in some but there isn't any. There are three insurgents and two URP soldiers, wearing civilian clothing so the guard. Twenty two have pass-words, they won't let any legitimate personnel inside. The URP soldiers were part here before the insur-gency broke out. When are they wasting around with the URP?

RESERVE: In relation to the PCs but are on alert. If the PCs could Marines them; if they PCs try to force entry, the result will likely as been assault.

If the PCs are successful, there will surprise the firepower and URP, who will try to bluff their way out of the situation. One has a coded comm but there is a [illegible] in the URP frequency. Listen in on communications, and many reports field. The URP frequency; where they won't navigate the map.

DISTRICT WEST

Most of the businesses and residences here are closed and boarded up.

WILDCATTER CAR PARK

There are 15 vehicles here (page 85). Seventeen are parked under tarps, Lashed down for the storm, and can be hotwired (DECRY HOTWIRE DFF).

THE INSURGENT COMPOUND

The former arena car wash is the most well-to-do residential area and is well fortified. Windows have metal shutters and some doors drift has the reinforced heavy Cabling: Piping 8 and can take 8 points of a ballistic.

FINDING THE COMPOUND

Any insurgent captured at any time can be interrogated, he will the PCs that it is located just around the corner from the Wildcatter. The insurgents always meet at the location here. If they roll badly, the Insurgent will ambush the location of Borax'. Compound and capture the, the to Borg's headquarters. The Insurgent Compound's location can be learned from any conversation about a Station and the Old Refinery. If any PCs are captured, they by the Insurgent here. If they are all eliminated, the players only will now to where they're coming from, a residential compound in District West.

One way or another, the players will get themselves there.

YARDS: Pristine and stolen with motor drifts, the yard is called. The vehicles are all color motley and [illegible] by the shack. Four assassine insurgents guard the yard with AR rifles. Challenge a PCs doesn't kill [EX].

GUARD SHACK: Two more master insurgents are online are in a battle with a Fighters fight-off. Three AVs sit behind the shack near the closed front gears. During the night they arrive and light ago.

The sounds of the fighting here emerge from the but lights shelled double-back-down. While it takes them [illegible] in most of the house, they will hear guffaws and terrified screams—as Roofs tears the victims apart.

She's an incredible foe, especially for low-level heroes. Violence between house and them take that for each PC. They can see where she's been, but he is [illegible] at an odd angle.

ASSAULTING THE COMPOUND

The PCs now have their chance to impact the town itself. Some time should be devoted to this assault. Examine the player's options and [illegible] skill, the choices and results along in it.

MOONSIDE LOCATIONS

► FOYER: Three broken bodies lie crumpled here, their ribs crushed. Bullet holes decorate the wall. The door to the studio is ajar and sounds of furniture being overturned can be heard.

► STUDIO: The door is ajar. This windowless room is an open living space with a table and a cushioned booth. Inside this room are four AK-4047 armed insurgents busy knocking over the table and pulling up a section of the flooring beneath it. They are concentrating on escape but are watching the door terrified that Wójcik might stumble upon them. Amongst them is Inna Botos, and the floor hatch leads to a crawl space that stretches to the yard on the far side of the house. The insurgents will cover Botos as he attempts to retreat into the crawl space. Shortly thereafter, a loud thumping and screams can be heard upstairs—they might want to see what's up there.

► UPSTAIRS HALL AND ROOF: There are two doors and a ladder leading up to a skylight here. There is an insurgent guard on the roof, who may have seen Wójcik on the rampage. If so, he is distraught and terrified.

► GUEST BEDROOM: The door here is broken down. The bed is overturned, the dresser smashed. On the nightstand is a pack of imperials, four M40 HEDP grenades, and $74 UPP.

► MASTER BEDROOM: Something damaged the door frame here as well. Only faint planet-light falls through the high-set window (the room is DARK). Only a broken chair and loose ropes stand out at the room's center. A steady hum permeates the air, emanating from a darkened alcove in the far corner.

By the alcove in the far corner, six bloody corpses with their necks snapped lie piled like a nest. Curled up in the pile is a ghost of a woman—it's Sergeant Wójcik. 26 Draconis has not been kind to her—veins like spiderwebs crawl across her slick, sweaty skin. Wójcik shakily stumbles to her feet, staring at the PCs like she's ready to devour them. Her crazed eyes reflect the weak planet-light. "I need some relief," her voice shudders.

Wójcik will use her ENTHRALLING GAZE ability to try to slip past the PCs. If attacked, she launches into close combat with the PCs, transforming when you feel it is appropriate. If Wójcik is seriously wounded, her Bodyburster or transformation is immediately triggered, negating any damage. When she makes the change, read aloud the boxed text below.

► ALCOVE: A demolished military grade portable computer and a UPP comm unit (the source of the dull hum) occupy this little room. After the PCs have faced the Bodyburster, the enemy comm will squawk to life, "Operation is go—find cover!" Act II then begins.

**THE BODYBURSTER**

Wójcik shrieks and rips out tufts of her own hair—no, it's not just hair—she's peeled her scalp away with it. Her skull bubbles out the back of her head, elongating as something wet and black inside her splinters her jaws and splits her teeth at you. Her body is next—bones buckle and dislocate under impossibly elastic skin, rearranging themselves into something hideous.

Wójcik's screams shift from madness to monstrous. With a wet pop, her spinal cord distends and splits down her leg like a bony-black tail. Fluted tubes erupt from her back. Stretched past any limit, her dermis finally rends, revealing a smooth cylindrical-skulled beast wearing a morbid mask of the woman's face.

How this behemoth fit inside her is beyond comprehension. The Wójcik-thing sloughs off her flesh suit. Her eyes slide down her now sable skull. Mad eyes tumble from ebon sockets to roll across the floor. In their place is nothingness—two Stygian voids where eyes should be, set in a metal-mouthed skull-face attached to a long, curved head. No longer human, the monster that was Wójcik can only be called alien.

# FORT NEBRASKA GROUNDBASE

You'll find a general overview of Fort Nebraska on page 7. Below, the specific areas of the fort are described. The ground base is described as it appears in Act III, after the UPP attack and the black goo bombing of the colony (page 57). If needed before then, you will have to wing it. Restricted areas (Sublevel 03) are inaccessible to the PCs at that time.

In Act II, there's pandemonium within the fort as the aliens wreak havoc. By Act III, Nebraska is on containment protocol lockdown, everything is DARK, and the reactor is dead. Only the A.P.O.L.L.O. mainframe and Sublevel 03 still run on battery reserves and have minimal lighting. Once inside, the PCs are in for a world of hurt. The Fort's been completely overrun by Xenomorphs, including the docked climber.

The climber's cargo bay, docked at Sublevel 03, is the center of the nest—and is also the PCs' only chance to escape Ariarcus. Make sure the players understand this.

In order to climb, the space elevator needs power. The PCs will need to make their way to the reactor, restart it, and then reboot the mainframe so that they can convince A.P.O.L.L.O. to assist in their escape. If so inclined, A.P.O.L.L.O. can open and close doors as requested and release the clamps on the climber car. Alternatively, the PCs can remove the clamps themselves (page 49) or just gun the climber's engine and hope for the best—but regardless power needs to be up and running. Along the way, they might want to stop in the ammo depot and get some nukes to wipe the overrun colony off the moon.

MAPS: You'll find floor plans of all areas of Fort Nebraska except Sublevel 03 on the back of the big colony map in this boxed set. Show the players this map once they arrive at the Fort in Act III. In this section of the book, you'll find GM versions of the maps with additional information. The map of Sublevel 03 is on a separate sheet and should not be shown to the players until they come here or access the floorplan from A.P.O.L.L.O. or an NPC.

**WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BASE?**

The UPP attack came as Project Life Force was conducting the off-moon transfer. Aliens escaped and containment protocols were activated. The base wasn't locked down to protect those inside—it was locked down to keep what was inside from getting out.

The ammo depot took a hit, several nukes were damaged, and the base was flooded with radiation. Before anti-radiation protocols did their job, that strange EMP blast (page 57) knocked everything offline. The reactor shut itself down and all orbital sensors and communications died. There is no record of whatever hit the moon and doused the colony with the mutagenic pathogen—the pulse wiped out any and all evidence from the recording devices.

MOONSIDE LOCATIONS

## BREAKING IN

Tips from NPCs, analysis of the base, or good old PC ingenuity could suggest the following viable methods of breaking into Fort Nebraska. Just be sure to reward player ingenuity—if the PCs come up with a crazy stunt to get on base that's not covered here, give them a chance to make it so. Don't force the players to make lots of dice rolls to enter—if they come up with a decent plan, let it work.

INSURGENT TACTICS: Ram the front gate with an armored vehicle packed with explosives.

TECHNOMAGIC: Just let the PCs try to override the gate—if the sentry guns don't get them first. Doing so is nigh impossible, requiring a formidable (-3) COMTECH roll.

PIPELINE: The oil's turned to silt, making it possible to travel inside the pipeline. The PCs can crawl down the pipe and enter the fuel tanks inside the complex. They just better wear some breathing gear (see Silt Exposure on page 82).

HEAVY METAL HAVOC: There are two possible tanks to commandeer—one out on patrol (page 56) and another at the Spaceport (page 22).

## ACCESSING SUBLEVEL 03

In order to reach the climber car and escape off-world, the PCs will need to pass through the restricted Sublevel 03 (see page 49 for details). Under normal circumstances, the space elevator does not stop here—it is only there now because of the evacuation.

Initially, the PCs are aware of Sublevel 03—they just believe it's a restricted weapons testing facility and are unaware of any bioweapon research there. They also know (and the players can see on the main Fort Nebraska map) that Sublevel 03 can be accessed through the Workforce Lift on Sublevel 02, as well as the Restricted Lift on North Bastion Level 02.

During the scenario, AWOLs Wright and or Carvalho will tell the PCs about Project Life Force and its work on Sublevel 03, as eventually will Ms. Eckford. Additionally, Chaplain knows about it as Jaell does—and he could inform the PCs of Project Lifeforce and its location when he is not controlled by her. If the PCs access the A.P.O.L.L.O. mainframe, they can find the information there, as well as the floorplan of Sublevel 03.

If they are with the PCs, Ms. Eckford, Colonel Meyers, and even Jaell will want to get to Sublevel 03 to retrieve samples. They will say anything to get there—from promising the PCs a lot of cash, drugs, and a better career path to claiming there are innocent people trapped down there (there are not). The PCs can also find their way to Sublevel 03 via the service tunnels which run throughout the base (use the table on page 39) or through the event "Acid is Your Friend" on page 61.

## KEY TAGS

A Fort Nebraska marine's plastic dog tags are coded for entry to areas befitting their clearance level. On lockdown, no outer doors can be opened, nor can automated outer defenses be shut down. Unless A.P.O.L.L.O. is persuaded to unlock the base, only key tags belonging to marines ranking major or above will open the internal doors. Only qualifying officers were on base when things went to hell. Without the key tags, each door must be cut open: a Turn of effort and an easy (+1) HEAVY MACHINERY roll using a torch gets it done. But don't forget NPCs. Ms. Eckford, if she's still alive, has a Major-level dog tag and a need for allies, and if they find Major Hatfield's body, he will have one too.

--- PAGE 39 ---

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

## TERMINAL ATROCITY

The PCs will likely look for one of the many terminals on base to find out more about the fort's condition. While information is limited, any PC accessing the base's computers from within and making a COMTECH roll will discover the following:

► Containment Protocol was implemented because of a bioweapons outbreak on Sublevel 03. The base also suffered some kind of radiation leak.
► A.P.O.L.L.O. is on standby and all doors are locked. Unless A.P.O.L.L.O. is brought back online and can be convinced to release the Containment Protocol, only key cards ranked Major or above will open doors. Otherwise each one will need to be bypassed.
► The reactor is shut down. Neither the climber car nor A.P.O.L.L.O. can be activated unless it is reset and restarted.
► The climber car is docked at Sublevels 02 and 03 and has security clamps in place—it isn't going anywhere unless they are physically removed, or A.P.O.L.L.O. can be convinced to unlock them.

## PERIMETER WALL

The wall is a 15-meter-tall slanted concrete scarp that surrounds the base with shielded sentry guns (page 125 in the core rulebook or page 89 in the Starter Set rules) positioned every 30 meters stop the outer wall. They have overlapping fields of fire. Illustrate the danger by having the occasional Freak Anathema stumble into the defensive perimeter. The sentry guns will chew the bastard to ribbons and then go quiet until their next target appears.

The field of fire is three zones deep but starts one zone out from the wall, meaning that brave PCs can make a mad rush across. While in the field of fire, a PC will be exposed to one attack per Round. A better alternative might be to use an armored vehicle for the approach. The system doesn't recognize transponder codes. Finally, if the PCs want to try to take out a shielded sentry gun, they will need to inflict 10 points of damage with a weapon with a base Damage rating of 3 or more.

GATE: This four-meter-high ramp-style metal door is also sentry gun protected. The gate has Armor Rating 12 and needs 20 points of damage to be broken down. However, weapons with a base Damage rating of 3 or less cannot damage the gate at all.

SALLY PORT: This double-laned 60-meter long paved corridor leads to the yard. As the PCs traverse this area, they get the distinct feeling they're being stalked.

SEALED SUBLEVEL RAMP: Situated directly at the end of the Sally Port but before the guardhouse, this ramp would normally lower into the ground to allow access to and from the motor pool tunnel on Sublevel 01. It has no snow on it—anyone standing on it will feel warm and anyone touching it will burn themselves. The PCs might suspect the tunnel is on fire. Nothing reasonable is going to crack this sealed door.

## ELEVATOR SHAFTS AND SERVICE TUNNELS

No elevators on base work until power is restored, but most shafts can be rappelled down. The PCs can also crawl through service tunnels (COMTECH ZONES), indicated on the map. When the PCs enter an elevator shaft or service tunnel, roll on the chart below or pick from the options to determine what makes the most sense for the PCs' current situation.

| LOADING DOCK 03 | Four (and two backup) Soldier Xenomorphs |
| CLIMBER CAR: LEVEL C/ CARGO | One Queen, two Soldiers, eight Worker Xenomorphs, Nine Ovomorphs with Facehuggers |

## THE GROUNDS

Barren and desolate, the grounds are littered with twisted, frozen bodies and wreckage. Black smoke billows from impact craters everywhere. From here PCs can see that the entire West Wing and Southwest Bastion have collapsed. All is quiet. There are three intact ATVs overturned here.

EASTERN GUN EMPLACEMENTS: Each of these automated, massive surface-to-space rail cannons is controlled from Operations in the North Bastion.

RETRACTABLE CANYON DOORS: These large fan doors spread over and seal the base's sub-levels from enemy attack, trapping the climber car below. They're currently locked and nigh impenetrable. Unlike the ramp door, however, they aren't hot to the touch. With power restored they can be opened from the Motor Pool, Operations, or Climber Control.

SURFACE STORAGE TANKS: These six massive spherical oil tanks are dry and about a third full of sparkling carbon silt. PCs entering through the pipeline will fall into it. There's a ladder within the tank that PCs can use to climb to the egress hatch above. Moving through the vast amounts of silt in the tanks requires a hard (-2) MOBILITY roll. Also, see page 82 for the effects of the silt.

## WEST WING AND SOUTHWEST BASTION

These collapsed buildings and the two gun emplacements near them are nothing but burnt-out rubble emitting Weak radiation (one Rad per Shift). Power cannot be restored to the base here, but there is a ladder well by the Power Station that lets out into a maintenance duct inside the Fusion Tower on Sublevel 02. It is buried but could be cleared. This is a CLUTTERED Zone. Attempting to move through it can cause the rubble to shift and trigger a cave in—have each PC make a MOBILITY roll, failure results in a fall of D6 meters.

## EAST WING

The medlabs and barracks located here are just smoldering, impassible rubble. This is a Strong radiation zone—but the PCs don't necessarily know that. If they still have it, Mason's CBRN Detection Kit (page 86) will come in very handy on the base. STRESS LEVEL +1 for each PC if they realize they are in a radiation zone. There is nothing worthwhile here at all—it's all destroyed.

## NORTH BASTION, LEVEL 01

The North Bastion is the Fort's command center and the outer alien hive. All of Level 01 is coated in resin and honeycombed with human bodies—dead or barely alive.

LOBBIES, NORTH COMMISSARY: These areas are all covered in sculpted secretions. There are seven people cocooned in each section. Every Turn spent in here, roll a Stress Die—on a facehugger symbol, a Chestburster (page 72) erupts from a victim and attacks. One of the victims is a dead Major with a key tag.

OFFICES, STORAGE, CHECKPOINTS: These rooms were firebombed by the marines to erase all evidence of the work done here. They are charred shells.

ARMORY 03: Any reasonable weapons the PCs might want or need are resin-cocooned here, including five HAZMAT suits (page 86). Breaking a weapon free requires one Turn of work and a Hard (-2) HEAVY MACHINERY roll.

SERVICE TUNNEL JUNCTION: These are the main entrances to the service tunnels that create a labyrinth throughout the base. Other entrances are indicated on the map. Traveling in these crawl spaces can be dangerous. See the table on page 39.

## NORTH BASTION, LEVEL 02

GANTRY: This skybridge stretches over the courtyard and connects at its center with the climber's personnel airlock—if the car is stopped here (it is not).

WAR ROOM, WAITING AREA, CHECKPOINTS, OFFICES: Explosives were set off in these areas, demolishing them.

OPERATIONS: This command center is a hexagonal room with five tactical stations (like the ones in an APC). The screens here display static.

This room can be closed off from the rest of the tower via its own airlock and used as a temporary resting place. Operations will come online if both power and A.P.O.L.L.O. are restored. All base functions can be monitored from here. If the PCs rest here, two Soldier Xenomorphs will become active and find their way in through the flooring. A HAZMAT locker here holds two suits.

RESTRICTED LIFT: This Lift goes directly to Sublevel 03 (page 47). Gaining entry to it requires the Key Tag of a Major, even if power is restored.

--- PAGE 44 ---

MOONSIDE LOCATIONS

► A.P.O.L.L.O. MAINFRAME: Both of the mainframe's entrances are sealed. This large pentagonal chamber has eight access terminals. The system is running on battery reserve and is asleep. While some information can be accessed remotely, only limited commands can be achieved until power is restored to the mainframe. Only by initializing the reactor on Sublevel 02 and then rebooting the mainframe here (takes one Turn once power is back on) can the PCs get the base operational. If power is restored, the PCs will find the base's files have been partially erased—but that there are repeated references to Project Life Force. They can use A.P.O.L.L.O. (and/or Jaell) to open doors, unlock climber clamps, retract the canyon bay doors, or anything else they need done (COMTECH roll). They can also find the floorplan of Sublevel 03.

► JAELL: A dark form stands out amidst the warm walls and sea of fading server lights—a diminutive wide-eyed woman sits at the third access terminal, catatonic. This is Jaell (page 16) on standby. Chaplain will not be immediately aware that she is responsible for his personality disorder. Examining her reveals a jack sticking in her arm, syncing her to the mainframe. This is a good time to run the "Under the Influence" event. Only disconnection will revive Jaell, requiring a COMTECH roll. Once Jaell is revived, she tries to ingratiate herself with the PCs and offers to help them. Jaell knows everything (see "What Happened to the Base?" on page 36) and can tell the PCs what Project Life Force is. Jaell will do her best to protect Meyers and covertly kill anyone not impregnated with Xenomorph embryos to achieve her goal.

## BASE SUBLEVEL 01

Much of this level is charred by fire, or still burning. HAZMAT suits are recommended. For fire rules, see page 108 in the core rulebook (page 74 in the Starter Set rules).

THE TUNNEL: The ground-level sealed ramp door connects to this two-lane tunnel, that gives access to the Staging Area as well as transporting ordinance and vehicles to and from the climber car station. A portion of the tunnel actually ramps down through Level 02 (in order to bypass the hangar bays), without any egress points on that level, then angles back up to connect with the climber at Sublevel 1. The tunnel is now filled with smoke and Intensity 9 fire. Radiation goes from Weak to Strong (one Rad per Turn) as the PCs near the ammo depot. While accessible through the motor pool, the tunnel is impassable near the climber car.

MOTORPOOL: Most of this area is still engulfed in Intensity 6 fire. Two functional M40E Ridgeway heavy tanks (page 85) rest in Bays 08 and 09. Reckless use of them will get the PCs buried in rubble.

DISPATCH OFFICE, LOADING DOCK 01, SUBHANGARS, EQUIPMENT SHEDS, FUELING STATIONS, PARTS STORAGE BAYS: All destroyed and charred by fire. The climber car cannot be accessed from the loading dock here, as it is caved in.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

STAGING: Fire smolders in this cavernous bay—all surfaces are hot and charred. A resupply ship crashed and burned here before lockdown sealed the overhead egress. There are two P5000 Power Loaders (can be salvaged with a Turn of work and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll) and the useless wrecks of three Cheyenne dropships here.

ARMING STATION: This open area overlooks the Ammo Depot below, exposing it to Strong radiation. A catwalk stretches over the munitions bay. If power is restored, a crane on ceiling tracks can retrieve missiles from Sublevel 02 and place them on a loading platform. The catwalk is the only way to reach the crane's control room.

FUEL STORAGE: These are filled with silt. Treat them the same as the surface tanks on page 39.

LIFTS: See the obstacle chart on page 39.

## BASE SUBLEVEL 02

This level is flooded with Strong radiation (unless otherwise noted) and is coated with Xenomorph resin. HAZMAT suits are recommended.

LOADING DOCK 02: This area is partially caved-in. The climber personnel airlock is stopped here (see Climber Level B), but it is inaccessible due to the cave in.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

MAINTENANCE PITS: The Xenomorphs have packed catatonic marine hosts shoulder-to-shoulder in these resin covered maintenance pits. Each Turn someone convulses and births a Chestburster. Irradiated and impregnated, the victims here are too far gone to save. Every few Rounds, a Drone Xenomorph drags an unconscious or dead human body here, tosses it into a pit, and leaves to find another. The Xeno is considered PASSIVE in relation to the PCs. However, if the PCs start to kill the hosts the Drone, and three Soldiers from the Fusion Tower, will rush to attack.

DECON 01: This is a hose-and-brush down facility with a communal bath. The showers are running and the room is steamed. Diluted blood has backed up the drains.

WORKFORCE/WEAPONS LIFT: This large lift is used to transfer staff and weaponry to and from Sublevel 03. Until power is restored, it is stuck at Sublevel 02.

CHECKPOINT: This burnt out former security room has a computer terminal that can be activated with a COMTECH roll.

POWER WALK: This long corridor to the Fusion Tower is filled with smoke and debris. The zone is CLUTTERED.

FUSION TOWER: Rebuilt from the colony's original atmospheric processor, the three-story underground tower powers the entire colony. Accessible only from this level, it is offline. A HEAVY MACHINERY roll and one Turn of work will reset the reactor. Once the work is done, the PCs must restart it from the Reactor Relay Room. One Shift is needed for the reactor to power up completely. It's impossible to overload the fusion reactor when it's on low power. Easier to set some timed nukes (see the Ammo Depot) and blow the colony sky-high. There are three hibernating Soldier Xenomorphs here, huddled amongst the Tower's machinery. These Xenos are initially PASSIVE.

REACTOR RELAY ROOM: Once the Fusion Tower is reset, an Easy COMTECH roll here starts the reactor (takes one Turn). There is large viewing window into the Fusion Tower, and a HAZMAT locker here with six suits.

COOLANT LOOPS: These massive coils are wrapped around the reactor core. If sabotaged while the reactor is at full strength, the tower will slowly build to critical mass—but the reactor is offline when the PCs enter.

AMMO DEPOT: All manner of ammunition, explosives and missiles can be found here—the smaller stuff in lockers, the larger missiles in bays. The 10-meter nukes are stored horizontally, their warheads removable. The radiation level here is Strong (one Rad per Turn). Nine crushed marine bodies litter the depot—victims of a massive Charger Xenomorph (page 77) still lurking in the area. The Charger is PASSIVE, but becomes active if alerted to the PCs' presence. Then it will wait to pounce until the PCs either work to set the nukes or restock on ammo. It will stalk the PCs until it is dead, but it can only fit through cargo and vehicle doors.

► NUCLEAR STORAGE: Acid scars mark the ordinance here. An alien's acidic corpse has burned through the housing of a warhead. Several missiles are leaking Strong radiation (1 Rad per Turn)—clearly the cause of the base's radiation issues. There are two of the old marines in HAZMAT gear here. One of the suits leaks. PCs making it into the Strong radiation nuclear storage depot should set nukes with at least an eight-hour delay—one hour to secure the climber, six for the ascent, and one to uncouple the tether from Counterweight Station). The PCs can realize this with a COMTECH roll. Setting a warhead for delayed detonation requires a HEAVY MACHINERY roll (one Turn of work).

► MUNITIONS: PCs can gather whatever grenades or ammo they may want here.

--- PAGE 48 ---

MOONSIDE LOCATIONS

## SUBLEVEL 03

This restricted level is radiation-free and home to the alien research center. If power is restored and A.P.O.L.L.O. is rebooted, a successful COMTECH roll allows the PCs to talk the computer into opening the level up. Otherwise, only torches, explosives, or a tank will do it.

CHECKPOINT, FIRING RANGES, WEAPON LABS: These rooms have been torched and their computers vandalized.

HAZMAT PREP: An airlock style changing room, the Lift from North Bastion Level 02 goes directly here. There are four remaining HAZMAT suits accessible.

ALIEN CONTAINMENT STAGING: This deep storage area's door is open. The walls are one-meter thick steel-reinforced concrete. Most of this section has been cleared of bugs.

► COLD STORAGE 001-003: These warehouse-sized rooms are vacant. Mechanical scratch marks on the floor indicate heavy equipment was moved out fast.
► COLD STORAGE 004: An abandoned Power Loader stands near the door, its back to the entrance. This room is filled with rows of human-sized cold storage stasis tubes. While most of them appear to be empty, a soft blue fluorescence and a whispered bubbling both emanate from the back of the room. The third aisle has twelve occupied chambers. Each one holds a suspended and PASSIVE Soldier Xenomorph immersed in a viscous, glowing blue fluid—just waiting for an excuse to wake up. If someone is stupid enough to shoot at one of the tubes, it will shatter and the now ACTIVE Xeno inside will rise one round later. Draw Initiative.

SUBLEVEL MEDLAB: Relatively unscathed, this room contains four Autodocs with matching diagnostic computers. A single examination table holds a strapped down corpse, gagged, with a hole in his chest—his ribs bent outwards as if he exploded from inside.

► OVERHEAD PHARMACEUTICAL CABINETS: Medkits and any drug the PCs might want can be found in some quantity here (GM's discretion).

QUARANTINE LAB AND SURGICAL SUITE: The harsh strobe of emergency lighting flickers here. A Pauling Medpod takes center stage in this decagonal chamber, flanked on each side by medical monitoring stations. An array of surgical instruments lay scattered across the floor. There's one closet, but the other walls of the room appear to be glass doors. This room has seven stalls, each with a cot, sink, toilet, and thick plexiglass door/wall. The door has a waist height tray slot and a pair of computer-controlled robot arms used to administer drugs.

► STALLS 03-04: These blackened stalls each contain the distinguished remains of a marine—Warrant Officer Billy Edison in one, and Viveca Diaz in the other. Only their dog tags and shredded clothing remain. Opening the chamber releases the black accelerant unless sterilization protocols are initiated first.
► STALLS 05-07: These are empty.
► MEDICAL MONITORING STATIONS: The Medpod is programmed to surgically remove Chestbursters (MEDICAL AID roll, failure kills the patient) if power is restored. Sitting on one of the computer stations is a zip sleeve of full but unmarked syringes. Anyone examining them without medical skills will believe they are stimulants. The PCs don't know it, but these needles contain the 26B Draconis Strain—a weaponized version of the Draconis Strain derived from Wójcik's blood (this is where the fugitive marines were originally inoculated before they went AWOL). If a PC is injected, they will become a Bodyburster and burst in one Shift (page 80).

► SURGICAL STORAGE: Any surgical tool or anesthetic the PCs might want can be found here, as well as Ms. Eckford's bug-out bag. Inside she has a folded and pressed $6,000 business suit, $100,000 in W-Y cash, two medkits, six doses of recreational drugs, a vial containing the 26B Draconis Strain, and a 03 Electronics Genesis. If Ms. Eckford gets back to her bag (see the "Let's Make A Deal" event on page 60) and had promised anyone X-Stims, she gives them the 26B injection instead.

ISOLATION WARD: This entire section is destroyed by fire—there's nothing left.

LOADING DOCK 03: Metal and plastic corridors give way to walls and ceilings of sculpted resin riddled with gaping orifices and steaming vulvae. The open outer hatch of the space elevator lies ahead, its inner cargo hatch slightly ajar. This is where it gets rough. Four massive Soldier Xenomorphs lie hidden within the corridor's crevices—all dormant, for now. If these are provoked, two more are standing by and will arrive four Rounds later. This is the heart of the hive. See Climber Level C for what's next.

## CLIMBER CAR

In Act III, there's a single climber with its hatches stopped at Sublevel 02 and 03. The wedge-shaped climber car is three stories tall. The climber's motors are assisted by treads which pull it along the cable.

CLAMPS: The climber is locked in place by four giant clamps beneath the car controlled by a central junction box. Accessed through a maintenance duct in the flooring below, the junction box can be hacked to release all four clamps. This takes a successful HEAVY MACHINERY roll and one Turn of work. If A.P.O.L.L.O. is running again, he can be convinced to release the clamps from the mainframe room (page 43) with a COMTECH roll, taking one Turn. As a last resort, the PCs can gun the engine and try to overpower the clamps (a slow action). The PC at the controls must make a PILOT roll with a -2 modifier. If they succeed, they break the clamps and are free to go. If the roll is failed, they blow the climber's motors. Repairing the engines requires a hard (-2) HEAVY MACHINERY roll and a Shift of work—if the PCs can survive that long.

LEVEL A/CONTROL: The top level is a windowed control station (shutters are initially closed). The climber is activated and controlled from here. It's functional once power is restored. A ladder junction goes from here to the lower levels.

AIRLOCK ENTRANCE ON LEVEL B: A fused personnel airlock is located here. It cannot be accessed without compromising the climber's hull. Entry must be from the cargo doors below.

LEVEL B/PERSONNEL: This level has two theater-style briefing rooms with seating for 25 in each.

--- PAGE 51 ---

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

AIRLOCK ENTRANCE ON LEVEL C: The outer hatch is open, with the control panel just inside the airlock. The inner door is ajar with less than one-meter clearance. Successful STEALTH rolls get the PCs into the airlock, and HEAVY MACHINERY seals the outer hatch.

LEVEL C/CARGO: This is where the fun begins. This is a large six-meter tall cargo bay. A ladder by the door leads up to a catwalk situated three meters above the floor and another ladder to the next level (Read the "Going Up" boxed text to the right to the players). There is a Queen Xenomorph here with nine full eggs, two Soldier Xenomorphs and eight Worker Xenomorphs. All Xenos start off as PASSIVE. The PCs need to make a MOBILITY roll each Round to stay undetected. As soon as anyone fails a roll, the Xenomorphs all become ACTIVE. Remember that anyone getting too close to an egg can trigger the Facehugger inside (page 70). Starting when the PCs see her and every Turn thereafter, the Queen releases another Ovomorph.

► MOTHER'S NOTE: During the UPP Invasion, the Queen was being loaded aboard the climber. In the resulting chaos, she broke free and set up her nest in the climber's cargo bay. The PCs can either clear her and her brood out or lock themselves in with her and start their ascent. Killing Xenomorphs in the climber is dangerous, as their acid will eat through any area not coated in resin (mostly the bay is safe). An additional PASSIVE Soldier Xenomorph hides somewhere in the climber car to be used at the GM's discretion. If the team hitches a ride outside, the Queen herself will push open the cargo doors and climb after them. ■

**GOING UP**

The air here is fetid. The cargo bay floor is covered with ropy tendrils and shattered storage units peppered with large leathery bulbs. Squat, blind, albino aliens scurry to and fro, regurgitating resin and smearing it across the walls. Some of them scuttle up the sculpted surfaces, hopping across the meter-thick secreted strands that stretch above and to the center of the bay. Suspended there is a nightmare. Curled up on a massive translucent sack is a tall and gangly ebon monster—its person-sized black-blue head crest dwarfing the pasty creatures crawling over it. The white creatures attend to the behemoth above, their obscene pink tongues lashing out to polish their sable Queen's splayed crown. In return, she squeezes her bulbous ovipositor, depositing one more egg beneath her.

# EVENTS

The following section contains events that you can spring on the players, divided into Act I, II, and III. The events don't all need to occur, and they don't need to occur in the order listed. Instead, see the events as an arsenal of drama for you to use as you see fit. Some events are mandatory however—these are clearly indicated as such.

Remember to also give the players new Personal Agendas at the start of each Act.

**PLAYER CHARACTER EVENTS**

Some events apply to specific PCs. If that character happens to be an NPC when the event is played, still run the event, applied to the character noted in the event text, and see how it plays out with the PCs!

## ACT I: MANHUNT

As the assembled strike force leaves orbit for LV-038, the PCs begin their search.

WHAT GOES UP: A colonist swears at the marines, certain the military is leaving them there to die. If questioned, he will insist he has proof and move to a spot to view the space elevator. Despite the lockdown, it is moving again—Fort Nebraska is still evacuating. If asked, base support will say it's classified.

BLIZZARD CONDITIONS: The Ariarcus weather goes bad, and a blizzard rolls into town. Any outdoor combat further than SHORT range and all OBSERVATION rolls get a -2 modification due to poor visibility. The storm will break after one Shift, depositing up to a meter of snow.

MS. ECKFORD'S DOG CATCHERS: Weyland-Yutani XO Ms. Eckford (page 17) and her four APE suited W-Y commandos (page 19) are also searching for the fugitive marines, but she wants them alive. You can start this event early in Act I, and have Eckford approach the PCs to see if they might co-operate with her, as their goals are the same. If questioned about her knowledge she will say "I'm Weyland-Yutani—we know everything." She can track the PCs through their PDTs and has hacked their squad tactical systems (comms, cameras). If the PCs attack an AWOL, Eckford will try to stop them—she's seen their scans and the proof the alien can be weaponized (See "Doctor's Prognosis" on page 31 for details). If cornered, she will trade information on Project Life Force and Sublevel 03 of Fort Nebraska in exchange for her safety.

CORPORAL WRIGHT (MANDATORY): While this would work well at the Spaceport (page 20), this encounter can be placed wherever you see fit. Also, if you wish you can place her in the Insurgent Compound, hand-cuffed to a radiator alongside Wójcik. A hooded woman tries to avoid the PCs. If called out, she'll run. This is the AWOL Corporal Wright, and she trusts no one. She is a deadshot with her scope rifle and will set her G2 Electroshock Grenades to cover her retreat. For more, see boxed text "The Wright Stuff" on page 54.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

**THE WRIGHT STUFF**

Confused and frightened, Corporal Wright now realizes that going AWOL was a terrible mistake, with the UPP representing nothing but a false hope. She wants to get help from the PCs, but fears she will be shot on sight. If she escapes an encounter with them, she will stalk the PCs from a high vantage point and look for a safe chance to surrender—she might even take out their equipment and weapons via her scope rifle—but will not kill a fellow marine if she can avoid it.

If the PCs convince Wright to surrender (MANIPULATION), she will talk. She will say there is a monster in her chest and it's Colonel Meyers' fucking fault and she'll tell how they were face-fucked by the things that Meyers is growing on Sublevel 03—things that put babies in your chest, babies that burst out and kill you when they are born. The techs said they inoculated them with something called the "26 Draconis Strain"—said it was supposed to kill the things growing in them. Wójcik said it was shit—it wouldn't work and was going to make them worse—so they went AWOL. She says Wójcik wanted them to find the Insurgency and turn themselves over to the UPP for medical attention. She doesn't know where the others are, only that they all met with a shifty insurgent contact at the bar. They argued and went their separate ways. In addition, Wright knows everything about Sublevel 03 and Project Life Force (she was security for it, after all), and will answer any questions the PCs may ask.

If Wright gets a medical scan, they can see the dead embryo, but she will assume that's a lie at first. Wright has been cured and it's critically important that she's returned safely to Fort Nebraska for more research into the cure.

Wright can serve as a replacement PC if needed.

ACID REFLUX: Sometime during the manhunt, let the PC Dante know that her back is killing her. Soon, she will start feeling the pain in her ribcage as well. Eventually she'll taste bile and feel a burning and squeezing in her chest—like a knot right behind her breastbone. Give the player the Story Card entitled "Acid Reflux"). Dante's carrying a Chestburster that will birth sometime in Act III (page 61).

AMBUSH: A team of five insurgents led by Botos ambushes the PCs and attempts to take prisoners. Any PC captured will have their PDT removed and will be blindfolded, stuffed in a tractor, and driven to the insurgent compound for interrogation in the Studio on the first floor (page 35). Botos wants to know about Project Life Force.

HAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD? A Postulant named Luke from the Church of Immaculate Incubation is handing out copies of Space Beast at the PCs' location. If the PCs will let him read to them from the Book of Morse, Luke will reveal he saw two of the missing marines (Wójcik and Carvalho) check into San Rocco Medical Facility this afternoon.

LOCATION ACQUIRED (MANDATORY): After the PCs learn the location of the Insurgent compound and report it in, Major Hatfield orders the squad to mount an assault. If they have captured or killed all the insurgents at the Refinery, they have time to return to Fort Nebraska to plan and re-arm, but if an insurgent escaped Hatfield orders an immediate assault. A Cheyenne dropship is made available in either circumstance. Read more on page 34.

--- PAGE 56 ---

EVENTS

## ACT II: THE STORM

As dim rays of reflected sunlight caress the colony, the PCs' comms squeal to life with orders, "Charlie Team, return to base. Repeat, return to base for immediate evac—" they blare, and then spen static. Booms echo above—the result of both bomb blasts and multiple sonic incursions. The fort's rail gun cannons begin launching giant spikes into the clouds. USCMC EVAC fighters scream across the sky, firing on descending UPP dropships. War has come to Ariarcus (STRESS LEVEL +1 for all PCs).

The UPP invasion will come in waves:
► The UPP unleash an orbital bombardment on the colony—incinerating buildings, striking the base, and clearing the Möngiyan in orbit.
► UPP ground forces arrive and attack the fort, the Spaceport, and the Oil Fields—cutting off all routes to the base.
► Enemy dropships unload OX transports at the Spaceport and Old Refinery.

Many colonists cheer their arrival while others hide in fear. Battles rage throughout play. Most colony descriptions have Act II cues listed. In general, while all locations are the same, they will likely be damaged, the people there frantic.

**GET BACK TO BASE**

Make sure the PCs understand that they need to get back to the base to get off this rock. Some will want to get Wright back to help find a cure for the Xeno infections. Have them see explosions coming from within Fort Nebraska and notice the artillery batteries soon stop firing. But the assault is leaving the space elevator untouched—maybe it's too valuable to the UPP. Anyone—including marines—trying to enter the base must face the automated defenses. As the PCs near the base, run "Falling Skies" below and then move to Act III.

**ON THEIR OWN**

The PCs have operated under Major Hatfield's command for Act I—now it's time for them to act on their own. Hatfield's last message to them is desperate: "I'm leading a last-ditch counter-attack against UPP forces assaulting Nebraska—we are out-numbered, but it's our duty to fight back. You are on your own. Your orders are to complete your mission if you can, find any remaining AWOLs, and then rally at Fort Nebraska. Make the Marine Corps proud..." Regardless, his death will raise the stakes.

## ACT II EVENTS

RESTART (MANDATORY): A muffled explosion comes from the direction of the fort, causing Chaplain to stagger to his knees. The android's eyes roll back in his head and he reboots. Up and running again, Chaplain is free of Jaell's interference and aware of any terrible things he might have done in Act I. This event should occur early in Act II, as it triggers Chaplain's Personal Agenda for the Act.

--- PAGE 57 ---

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

UPP ON THE HUNT: As the PCs are escaping the Insurgent Compound, a sleek UPP Krokodil dropship, expertly piloted, lands and they see six UPP troopers dash into the compound buildings. If they have taken a UPP comms unit it crackles into life: "We are too late, the cargo is gone, no survivors." Then: "There are tracks, commander, they cannot be far." The UPP Space Operating Forces, commanded by Vice Sergeant Major Davydovich (page 18) with eight David 1 UPP Combat Synthetics, are after them, and the hunt begins. As the Act progresses, the PCs should feel that it's a struggle to stay one step ahead. Eventually, either the UPP attack, or this is an opportunity for the PCs to lay a tactical trap and turn the hunters. Davydovich will withdraw if they are losing the fight.

DROPSHIP DOWN: Cheyenne dropships fly to and fro overhead. The PCs might want to try flagging one down, or one might offer them a ride. The PCs might even still have the dropship from the assault on the Insurgent Compound. Regardless, they may try to reach base by air—a move that will get them part of the way to their destination before the dropship is struck with a missile and is Wrecked (page 88). Fortunately, the dropship was only one zone up when hit, meaning the base damage on each PC is 3 (mitigated by MOBILITY).

MY SYMPATHIES: The PCs spot Fei? going into a nondescript building. If they investigate, they find a safehouse with a dozen refugees, families of UPP enemies. Fei? is caring for them (page 25). While she is running the bar for the UPP occupation force, Fei? is also secretly aiding any UA loyalists and marines. She can get the PCs medical supplies, weapons, and food—all she asks is that they get these people to safety—be it inside the Fort or off-moon, and will angrily berate them if they refuse.

IT FISSURES: The PCs come to an area where the buildings are cracked and leaning, as a result of the oil-eating bacteria (page 82). Suddenly, the ground before them gives way, collapsing into a sinkhole. Each PC needs to make a MOBILITY roll—those who fail fall D6 meters and need to climb out. Also, the way forward is blocked.

A SPLASH OF COLOR: Moving through the warzone, the PCs hear explosions and gunfire, eventually including the loud bang of an echoing rifle shot. While they are not under attack, the PCs will most likely take cover. A drop of blood will splatter on Dante's chest—an OBSERVATION roll by anyone looking her over will reveal the drop came from her nose, not any bullet wound. This is a symptom of her being a Chestburster carrier (page 72).

IT'S A TANK!: A loud boom echoes through the deserted alleys, shaking the snow off nearby roofs. Three marines (Privates Norton, Evans, and Renner) are holed up in a Ridgeway M-40E Heavy Tank (page 84). Their commander is dead. They are firing at a UPP Ox (page 84) several blocks away, but a successful OBSERVATION roll reveals four insurgents hiding nearby and carrying M5 RPG Launchers. The insurgents are preparing to ambush the tank but are PASSIVE to the PCs.

THE EXECUTIONS: The PCs turn a corner and see a horrid sight: three UPP soldiers are lining up seven civilians against the battered wall of a low building. They are PASSIVE to the PCs at the start. The civilians are clearly terrified. It becomes clear that the UPP are going to execute them, which they do if the PCs do not intervene (STRESS LEVEL +1 to each)—just another seven innocent UA victims. If they save them the surviving prisoners will want to tag along to safety at Fort Nebraska.

FALLING SKIES (MANDATORY): Act II draws to a close when you feel the guerrilla war has run its course. The hairs on the back of each PCs' neck and arms tingle as a massive EMP burst from above knocks out most electronics—even those that would otherwise be shielded. All electronic items carried by the PCs are knocked out (needing a COMTECH roll to fix), and Chaplain suffers an attack with six Base Dice (base Damage 1). Blue lightning arcs both above and down each alley. Electronics pop and fry. All shooting stops. Soon, burning husks of dropships from both sides fall out of the sky. One ship crashes very close to the PCs. Have each PC make a MOBILITY roll to get out of the way. Failure exposes the PC to a Blast Power 9 explosion. After this plays out, move to Act III. Something ominous moves above the clouds.

*"It was an unknown weapon, a gigantic messenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race. The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without apparent cause, and the birds turned white."*

—THE MAHABHARATA

## ACT III: THE LION'S DEN

The mammoth shadow of a ship (whose exact shape cannot be seen) comes to a stop over the colony about four kilometers away from the PCs' position (give the PCs a chance to find cover before death comes). The colony suffers a black goo bomb attack—just as when David bombed the Engineer colony in the film, ALIEN: Covenant (see the "Black Death" boxed text to the right and the image on the next page. STRESS LEVEL +1 for all PCs.

Consult the Black Goo Bomb Range Chart and place the bomb's drop-point so that the PCs' location is on the Periphery when the strike comes. One Round later, the aftershock winds hit the PCs with apparently no effect—apparently. See Periphery on the table on page 59.

After one Turn, all areas of the colony exhibit Periphery effects. The mutagenic pathogen will not fully dissipate until everything is dead or mutated into Anathemas. It's possible to survive in any zone with full compression, vacuum, or HAZMAT gear. APE suits will only protect in Periphery conditions. Basically, anything with an independent air supply—like a sealed APC or grounded ship with an intact cabin—is safe. Tractors and buildings are not. Firefights will break out far less often as survivors seek allies. Ms. Eckford, Fei?, Botos, or anyone you see fit will want to join forces.

**BLACK DEATH**

A succession of airbursts explode overhead, turning the skies pitch black as something like rain begins to fall. Panicked colonists, marines and enemy troops alike scramble for cover—but it's too late. A churning black tar erupts from their retching throats and eyes. A convulsing man tears at his face as the woman next to him shrieks at the clouds. The dying climb over each other, twisting in agony. Bodies bubble and ossify into grotesque black caricatures of life—forlorn souls forever crying out for their absent gods. People stumble from the airburst fall to their knees, black veins spider-webbing across splintering flesh as they crumble to dust. Others writhe in the blackened snow, their skulls pulsing and limbs stretching. You are in hell.

**WHO DONE IT?**

A big part of fear is not knowing what is going on. It's purposely never made clear who bombed the moon with black goo. It could be W-Y, the UPP, or even the Engineers. Don't decide. Let your players think you know but are just not telling them. This mystery, and the motives behind it, should remain unsolved.

| EPICENTER | 0-1 km | Automatic Petrification. Those in the immediate dropzone projectile vomit black fluid, convulse and ossify into twisted and ashen macabre statues. |
| KILL ZONE | 1-2 km | Automatic Disintegration. Victims become Terminal Anathemas (page 66) and disintegrate within D6 Rounds. |
| MUTATION ZONE | 2-4 km | Automatic Transformation. Within one Turn, victims morph into Freak Anathemas. |
| PERIPHERY | 4+ km | Infection. All victims are exposed to the atomized black goo with Virulence 3. If the Sickness Roll fails, the victim mutates into an Afflicted Anathema (page 65). Roll once per Shift. |

**THE WAY OUT IS UP**

With all the carnage around them—the spaceport is wrecked, the wilderness is frozen and the colony is dead, dying, or filled with abominable creatures—the PCs need to realize that getting into the base is still their only viable way to get off-moon. Locked down as it is, there are likely other marines inside that are either awaiting rescue or planning their own escape. Perhaps there's a working shuttle in there that survived the EMP blast. No matter what, there's that glorious space elevator—and a climber car should still be on station under the base.

Make sure to tell the players that climber cars are typically stopped with hatches open on Sublevel 01 and 02. Do not tell them, however, that the car is in actuality stopped at Sublevel 02 and 03—they will see that for themselves. Getting to Sublevel 03 will be a key challenge, but the PCs will know some useful information, based on how they played and what they learned in Acts I and II (see "Accessing Sublevel 03" on page 37). Some of the PCs will also want to make sure the pathogen is eradicated here—and there are nukes on the base that can be set to annihilate the colony. No matter how you slice it, the PCs are still Nebraska bound.

## ACT III EVENTS

TABLE FOR ONE: This event takes place on the desolate streets of the colony. Amidst the brutalized bodies of over a dozen Anathemas strewn across the cracked pavement, one Freak (page 65) sits in the rubble, gnawing on the limb of one of his dismembered brethren (STRESS LEVEL +1). He is PASSIVE, but if alerted he'll look to make the PCs his next meal.

SAFE HAVEN: While making their way through the colony, the PCs pass the wreckage of a crashed Krokodil gunship (page 85) lying buried in the rubble of the building it smashed into. An Intensity 4 Fire smolders in the surrounding rubble. The crew is dead. While the ship will never fly again, its cabin is intact and can offer a safe haven from the Black Death. The crash has also cracked open the main pipeline here, spilling silt—not oil (page 82). An easy OBSERVATION roll indicates that the person-sized pipe leads into the Fort—terminating in the oil tanks there.

CAN'T SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES: The PCs stumble across a forest of petrified corpses in a quiet colony square, all upright, twisted in agony, and reaching for the sky. A ten-year-old child named Justin wanders between the horrific human statues in a daze, looking for his father (STRESS LEVEL +1). The boy is a PASSIVE Ague Anathema (page 65) and will reach Terminal stage within one Turn.

LET'S MAKE A DEAL: This colony event can work in conjunction with another one such as "Safe Haven" (to the left). The PCs encounter Ms. Eckford or she has tracked them via their PDTs. Her Dog Catchers all dead, Eckford is looking for allies to get her back to base. She will use her Take Control Talent to influence them. If that doesn't work, she will offer them corporate security jobs, X-stims, and cash. She claims to have $200,000 in emergency cash in her bug-out bag on Sublevel 03 of the base, though this is a lie as she only has half that, along with a few other surprises (she is looking for an excuse to go there and retrieve samples). See "Surgical Storage" on page 48.

--- PAGE 62 ---

EVENTS

WHITE FLAG: As the PCs finish dealing with a previous event, the UPP android Davydovich suddenly approaches with his hands up, wearing no protective gear and speaking in calm, dulcet tones. He offers a truce and explains that the UPP forces have lost all contact with their ships. They don't know who dropped the accelerant and consider the colony a loss. He believes Fort Nebraska command is holed up tight, "drinking bad coffee and playing American baseball," while they wait for extraction. Or they're all dead. Regardless, Davydovich needs the PCs' help to get inside and get off this hell moon. "Survival is the only priority now," he smiles. It's up to the PCs to trust him or not. If they decline the offer, they will find there are six more UPP Androids nearby—all ready to kill on their commander's order.

THE END OF A GOOD MARINE: In an open area of Fort Nebraska there are signs of a hard fight. There are dead Marines, dead UPP soldiers, blood trails and carnage. In amongst it all is a sword with a white-handled hilt—unmistakably Major Hatfield's antique sword. There's a bloodied trail across the ground. If they follow it, they eventually find Hatfield's body, terribly wounded, in a darkened corner. It was as far as he could drag himself, with only one arm, the last resting place of a proud Marine. He has his Major-level access key card around his neck.

ACID IS YOUR FRIEND: Use this event inside Fort Nebraska if the PCs are having a hard time and an alien dies of massive hemorrhaging. A generous burst of acid blood will burn through one or two levels of metal flooring, inadvertently creating entry points to lower levels.

READY TO RUMBLE: In an open area of the fort, the PCs hear an echo of yelling. Four Freak Anathema marines are locked in close combat with three Soldier Xenomorphs. All are PASSIVE in relation to the PCs.

WHO HUNTS THE HUNTERS? Within the base, three marines (page 19)—Privates Howard, Horowitz and Fine—ambush one active Drone Xenomorph that is stalking the PCs. Each marine is host to a Chestburster, so the Drone will only subdue them. Each will burst within a few Rounds.

ONE OF US: Making their way through the base, the PCs are confronted by a Xenomorph Drone emerging from a vent near Dante. Instead of attacking her, however, it leers, seems to nuzzle up to her, and then withdraws. Due to the Chestburster she is carrying, Xenomorphs will never attack her. They will also protect her from harm. If she attacks them or corners them, they will snatch her up and take her to a hive wall for webbing.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE: At a dramatically optimal point, for example when the PCs visit the mainframe room (page 43), Jaell attempts to take control of Chaplain again. Make an opposed MANIPULATION roll each Round (no action). If Chaplain fails, give the player the Story Card entitled "Under the Influence". As soon as Chaplain resists Jaell's Manipulation, he regains control over his actions and can exact his revenge on Jaell—hopefully he hasn't done too much damage before then.

BUNDLING UP: In a tucked away place inside the Fort like a service tunnel or storage locker, three massive Chestbursters are cocooning—shedding their skin, spitting up resin and covering themselves with it. Gross.

COLONEL'S ON ICE: Abandoned somewhere in the Fort is an overturned cart with a lone blue-light stasis tube holding an older man with multiple contusions on his face. He is only wearing his underwear and dog tags. This is Colonel Meyers. The Colonel froze himself when the aliens overran the base. If Jaell is here, she starts to revive him whether the PCs want to or not (which could lead to combat). Awoken, Meyers will order the marines to get him off-moon. He will not reveal that he carries a Chestburster (and is thus immune to Xenomorph attack). It will birth in one Shift. His goal is to have it surgically removed at a safe location. He'll kill anyone who stands in his way.

BURSTING WITH JOY: If Dante hasn't gotten her Chestburster removed sometime within one Shift of Act III, she will burst. Finding the Medpod or 26 Draconis inoculations on Sublevel 03 could save her life. If not, make sure she pops at a dramatic moment.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

**LEAVING THE MOON: UP, UPP, AND AWAY**

After the climber has been traveling up the space elevator tether for one Shift, there's a great jolt as if something has impacted with the tether. The wreck of a UPP destroyer, the Trakhni Menya, has crashed into the space elevator, above the climber, causing the tether to bend and twist. Only a shredded slice of wrecked station and the attached power module survives. The tether loops around the wreck of a ripped-in-half UPP destroyer, the Trakhni Menya. The entire space around the moon is littered with bodies, debris, drifting support craft, and holed cruisers. The unresponsive climber car is stuck at speed and will smash into the Trakhni Menya, demolishing both and killing everyone. Fixing the brakes would take one Shift—there's not enough time.

An OBSERVATION roll will have the PCs spot several ejected colonial EEV pods drifting lazily near the tether—including an FTL capable Type 337 (see the boxed text below). There are two options:
► The PCs can spacewalk to the tumbling pod. A successful MOBILITY roll allows them to latch on and board her. Failure means they miss the target and are lost in space.
► They can also attempt to hack its autopilot with a successful COMTECH roll from the climber and remote pilot it to them with a hard (-2) PILOTING roll.

Onboard the climber, there are two ASSO-400 Harpoon Grappling Guns. There is also one less Mk.35 Pressure Suit than there are human PCs aboard. Everyone else is fucked. If anyone is carrying a Chestburster that hasn't yet popped, now's the time. If anyone is going to betray anyone else, this is where it will happen. A HEAVY MACHINERY roll gets the PCs into the EEV. Opening it reveals a floating dead body—a marine that didn't make it into stasis before death came. The PC who opens the hatch makes a Panic Roll. Inside are five cryosleep chambers.

If the PCs have set the fort to explode, the destruction of the ground base shakes the tether hard, pulling the climber car and the Trakhni Menya's wreckage into a doomed descent. The PCs had best vacate before they burn up. The tether will fall and wrap around the moon, obliterating everything along the equator, including the colony. ■

**CLASS C EEV TYPE 337 FTL**

An ICC standardized escape module, the L-shaped EEV Type 337 is built into the outer hull of many modern starships and can sustain a crew of five in stasis for upwards of fifty years. FTL range is limited to 1.4 Parsecs.

# EPILOGUE

**AGENDAS & STORY POINTS**

After it's all over, evaluate how well each player followed their PC's Personal Agenda for Act III, and hand out a Story Point to those who did. Then have the players reveal all their Personal Agendas for the scenario if they so wish, and have a debriefing discussion. Story Points belong to players, not PCs, and players can keep their Story Points to use in the next Cinematic Scenario if they wish. No player can ever have more than three Story Points, however. ■

SIGNING OFF

A suggested sign off message by one of the PCs, assuming anyone is still alive. The player can read the following message aloud, or adapt it according to what happened in the scenario:

Kruger 60 system. Final report from the USCMC base Fort Nebraska. [PC NAME and RANK] reporting. Colony attacked by unknown forces with advanced bioweapons. Project Life Force compromised. UPP and Cheiron Marine Forces wiped out. Colony and base destroyed. Those sands are dead. Only [NUMBER] of us have survived. I can only pray the damn Network picks this up before the UPP does. This is [PC NAME and RANK], signing off."

# APPENDIX I: THE XENOMORPHS

Destroyer of Worlds features a bevy of beasties both old and new. All Xenomorphs follow the general rules on page 290 in the ALIEN RPG core rulebook (also found on page 36 of the Chariot of the Gods scenario in the boxed Starter Set).

## ACCELERATED EVOLUTION: AGENT AO-3959X.91-15

A genetic accelerant created by an ancient race of alien Engineers, Agent AO-3959X.91-15 is a black, tar-like substance with both destructive and life-generating capabilities. While it exists in a viscous liquid form, it assumes when released in the air mutagenic properties that are responsible for the creation of Anathemas, Abominations, and other aberrant creatures. Simply put, any living thing that comes into direct contact with the black goo will die horribly, give birth to a monster, or become a monstrosity themselves.

--- PAGE 65 ---

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

# ANATHEMA

An Anathema is a terminal infection of a lifeform caused by exposure to certain strains of the black goo chemical agent (see the boxed text below). Anathemas must endure exponentially worse stages of cellular disruption, culminating in complete DNA disintegration. As there's no cure, an Anathema is consigned to damnation.

INFECTION: Direct exposure to the black goo is handled as a disease with Virulence 8. Contact with an infected Anathema can also cause infection (below). If the first Sickness Roll fails, the victim is infected and mutates into a Stage I ("Vitiate") within one Shift. At the beginning of the next Shift, and each Shift thereafter, the patient must make a new Sickness Roll against Virulence 8—failure will cause the patient to advance to Stage II ("Febrile"). Success on these secondary Sickness Rolls will not save the victim, only delay the inevitable. A Stage II Anathema must after one Shift make yet another Sickness Roll against Virulence 8—success means moving to Stage III ("Freak"), while failure means moving directly to Stage IV ("Terminal"). In either case, this means the end of the PC.

**PLAYING THE INFECTED**

If a PC is exposed to the black goo, have them make a STAMINA roll (the Sickness Roll) without telling them what it's for. If they fail, give them the Story Card marked "Infected, Stage I." When a PC progresses to Stage II, hand them the Story Card marked "Infected, Stage II." When a PC progresses to Stage III or IV, they become NPCs under your control—if possible, give the player another PC to play.

## STAGE I VITIATE "AFFLICTED"

► TRAITS: Paranoia, delirium, epiphora, onset of sepsis

Disorientation and weakness hits within one Shift. These symptoms can easily be dismissed as pesksey, the flu or a bad hangover, so if you're feeling them, don't take them too lightly. A Vitiate will exhibit increasingly bloodshot and watery eyes and an eventual endless stream of tears (STRESS LEVEL +1). Towards the end of the stage, small worm-like creatures can be glimpsed swimming in their eyes and bodily fluids—mutations of microorganisms normally found in the human body.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOLS: Isolation. And watch out for those eye worm things—they are contagious, leading to god knows what next. Direct physical contact with a Stage I Anathema without a HAZMAT suit (page 86) triggers a Sickness Roll against Virulence 4 to avoid infection.

--- PAGE 66 ---

THE XENOMORPHS

## STAGE II AGUE "FEBRILE"

► TRAITS: Vertigo, convulsions, extensive internal bleeding, respiratory failure

By Stage II, the accelerant has spread throughout an Ague's body, causing a severe feverish state followed by intense pain (STRESS LEVEL +1). The victim's bloodshot eyes darken—pupils and irises together become opaque. Varicose veins rapidly spread across their livid flesh as the black goo within them causes their skin tissue to deteriorate. During this stage, the victim gets +3 to Strength (and thus Health), but -2 to Wits (to a minimum of 1).

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOLS: Death by fire or nuke from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. Direct physical contact with a Stage II Anathema without a HAZMAT suit triggers a Sickness Roll against Virulence 6 to avoid infection.

ENTHRALLING GAZE: As a fast action, a Stage II Anathema can stare down a human victim in SHORT range with its pitch-black eyes. The victim must make a Wits roll (the attribute only, no skill) or be lost in the depths of those soulless voids, entranced and immobilized as the Anathema slowly bears down on them. If the roll fails, the victim loses their next fast and slow action. In addition, STRESS LEVEL +1 for the victim and all friendly PCs in SHORT range.

## STAGE III LUSUS "FREAK"

► TRAITS: Aggressive Dementia, Cerebral Dysmorphia

Similar to the creature called an Abomination (see Chariot of the Gods), a monstrous Freak is wracked with painful cellular mutations throughout their body. As the victim transforms into a creature of sheer rage, the rabid Anathema's head deforms and their limbs elongate. They barely remember their past lives but can still use basic tools. Freaks attack all living things on sight. Stage III Anathemas are handled as full Xenomorphs and have their own table for signature attacks (next page). PCs who enter Stage III become NPCs under your control. Direct physical contact with a Stage III Anathema without a HAZMAT suit triggers a Sickness Roll against Virulence 7 to avoid infection.

**STAGE III — FREAK**
SPEED: 2
HEALTH: 8

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

**FREAK ATTACKS**

| D6 | ATTACK |
|----|--------|
| 1 | HORRIFIC HOWL: The Freak throws its head back and roars, asserting its dominance. All PCs in SHORT RANGE must make an immediate Panic Roll. |
| 2 | FIST STRIKE: The Freak strikes its victim with a powerful punch. Roll for the attack with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. |
| 3 | EYE GOUGE: The Freak grabs the victim's head and tries to jab its thumbs into their eyes. Roll for the attack using seven Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack causes damage, it automatically triggers critical injury #34 even if the victim is not Broken, triggering an immediate Panic Roll. |
| 4 | BEAT DOWN: The Freak leaps onto its victim like a gorilla. Roll for the attack using eight Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack hits, the victim is knocked to the ground, drops any hand-held items, and must make an immediate Panic Roll. The Freak then starts pummeling the victim's head and chest with its powerful fists. This is resolved as an immediate bonus attack with ten Base Dice, Damage 2. |
| 5 | BEARHUG: The Freak pulls the victim to its chest and begins to squeeze. Roll for the attack using eight Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack causes damage, it automatically inflicts critical injury #56, triggering an immediate Panic Roll. |
| 6 | BLACK VOMIT: The Freak holds the victim down and vomits black goo all over their face. The victim must make a Sickness Roll against Virulence 10. Failure means they become an Anathema. If the victim wears a HAZMAT suit, the Freak first tries to pull the visor off—the victim must make an immediate CLOSE COMBAT roll (no action) to stop this. |

## STAGE IV NOCUOUS "TERMINAL"

► TRAITS: Agony, disintegration

When an Anathema enters Stage IV, large patches of skin rapidly darken and flake away. Muscle tissue and ligaments follow suit as bones grow brittle and snap. As the mutagenic pathogen reproducing inside a Terminal Anathema reaches critical mass, their cell membranes burst, inflicting one point of damage per Round. At zero Health, the victim dies immediately (no Death Roll) as their DNA disintegrates and the black accelerant becomes airborne, dispersing throughout the local ecosystem and killing or mutating any animal life it comes in contact with.

INFECTION: Anyone within SHORT range of an expiring Nocuous (same zone) without protective gear must make a Sickness roll against Virulence 8 to avoid Anathema infection. At MEDIUM range (adjacent zone) the Virulence is reduced to 4.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOLS: Too late. Hold your breath, get indoors. Tell your friends to get their incinerators. You're fucked.

THE XENOMORPHS

## XENOMORPH XX121

The focus of Project Life Force, Weyland-Yutani cataloged Xenomorph species number XX121 is an endoparasitic lifeform with a horrific lifecycle. Under development as a bioweapon in a joint-venture between the company and rogue elements within the government of the United Americas, these long-headed ebon terrors are indeed the stuff of nightmares.

All types of Xenomorph XX121 are described in detail in the ALIEN RPG core rulebook, but the types encountered in Destroyer of Worlds are included here for easy reference.

**OUR FIRST ALIEN**

Whenever the PCs first get a good look at any full-grown Xenomorph XX121 other than the Bodyburster, describe it thusly: The black biomechanical beast unfurls, slowly raising its elongated head. It leers at you—almost seeming to mock you and your feeble existence. The thing's mouth slobbers as ebon lips peel back—it's got metal teeth. Its spiked curled tail, pronounced ribs, protruding back tubes and eyeless face denote it as something inhuman, unnatural. Something alien.--- PAGE 69 ---

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

## XENOMORPH XX121 SPECIAL ABILITIES

The special abilities described below are common to all varieties of Xenomorph XX121.

ACID SPLASH: When a Xenomorph XX121 is wounded some of its acid blood may splash on its attacker and anyone within ENGAGED range. Each type of Xenomorph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash—hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xenomorph, and the more damage it has taken, the greater the splash.

The strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xenomorph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each facehugger rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammo and grenades, or burn through floors, writing, a ship's hull, and so on (at GM's discretion).

The acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see page 108). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over.

If a victim is Broken by the acid splash, or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a MEDICAL AID roll.

THE XENOMORPHS

*"Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous, it was a derelict spacecraft, it was an alien ship, it was not from there. You get it? We homed in on its beacon."*
*"And found something never recorded once in over three hundred surveyed worlds... 'A creature that gestates inside a living human host'—these are your words—'and has concentrated acid for blood'."*

—WARRANT OFFICER ELLEN RIPLEY AND AN ECA REPRESENTATIVE

SPRINT: All Xenomorph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions—i.e., through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into ENGAGED range of a target.

RESISTANCE TO VACUUM: The resilient physiology of Xenomorph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects.

FALLING: The Xenomorphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xenomorph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor.

IMMUNE TO THE COLD: Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xenomorph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way.

RADIATION: Xenomorph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects—i.e., the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls).

NO RESPIRATION: For all intents and purposes, a Xenomorph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed.

NO HEAT SIGNATURE: Xenomorph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

## STAGE I: OVOMORPH (EGG)

Large leathery objects, Ovomorphs are the beginning of the alien life cycle. They come in various sizes from 0.6 to 1.2 meters tall. While most open with four petals at the top, some only have a single slit that opens to reveal the Facehugger it carries within. These eggs are lifeforms in their own right, able to protect their precious cargo from blunt trauma and forced entry, while also sensing movement and awakening the parasite within accordingly. Naturally occurring alien eggs are generated in one of two forms—either they are the result of a transformation perpetrated on a living host, causing it to metamorphose into an Ovomorph, or they are simply birthed by a Queen. Queen produced eggs are hardier and healthier than those produced through ovomorphing.

OPENING THE EGG: If a potential host comes within ENGAGED range of an Ovomorph, the host must make a HEAVY roll each Round to not disturb it. If it fails, the egg will open and release a Facehugger. An Ovomorph can release its Facehugger at SHORT range—roll a Stress Dice each Round. On a facehugger, the Facehugger is released.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL: If you shoot an egg with a rifle, the bullet is likely to deflect off its rubbery hide. Fire is a proven method of sterilizing them, and explosives do the trick as well. Keep in mind that the eggs are essentially vats of acid, and when exploding will cause acid damage accordingly. Extreme cold can make an egg dormant.

| HEALTH | 2 | 3 |
| SKILLS | None | None |
| ARMOR RATING | 2 (0 vs fire) | 3 (1 vs fire) |
| ACID SPLASH | 4 | 5 |

## STAGE II: FACEHUGGER

Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xenomorph designed for one task only—the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacs, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host's face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature's throat.

FACEHUGGING: The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within ENGAGED range. In combat, a successful signature attack #5 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xenomorph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host's own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xenomorph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host.

STAGE III: CHESTBURSTER

The alien chestburster's exoskeletal defense mechanism is a lethal, hissing and reaching a point of maturity where it is no longer dependent on its host for survival. While maintaining a parasitic link to the host, a creature grows within them, some comment that they feel something they have lost. Attack on more of the life of the host, as once the alien has grown fully, it will kill the host.

Jaundiced being in color, the pike-like Chestburster has a mouth full of metallic canines. Dependent on the strength of parasitic-a Chestburster could easily have the arms or tusks of its host. As the creature grows from within, and as the host's viscera is soon softened to a point where the Chestburster can penetrate the soft skin and organs without resistance, it will burst free, tossing off precious human tissues, instead and organ around.

THE BIRTH: The birth of the Chestburster kills the host outright. The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth.

CONTACT AND TERMINATION
PROTOCOL: Surgical attempts to remove an embryo-Chestburster is liable to cause maternal death or severe and permanent injuries. Burn is along it to intra the gestational period—the death of the alien as well as the Chestburster could be lethal itself. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and flamethrowers. Once free of its host, immediately acts upon a place to hide and launch attacks upon the human population is common. Once it has shed its fluids, veins and metals to increase their threat. Sufficiently fatal, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color as it grows and will manifest the rapid development of the metamorphosis to the next Stage.

CHESTBURSTER ATTACKS

DS    ATTACK
1     STRIKE: Leaps at the Chestburster
      lunges wildly at its target from the nest
      of any creature before, into the nearest vault, sewer or duct
      available. If the target has managed to
      see the Chestburster before it appears, they
      can simply run away before the Chestburster
      can strike. Roll Base Dice. Damage 1: If
      the attack causes damage, the victim takes a
      Critical Injury Roll.

2     TAIL LASH: The Chestburster attempts to
      strike the target with its barbed tail, causing
      injuries and making the target unbalanced.
      If the impact is hard enough, the victim
      must make an immediate Panic Roll.

3     WHIP BITE: The Chestburster squeals at
      its victim. This attack is difficult to
      defend against, but it does not cause
      them any harm. Roll for the attack with
      eight Base Dice. Damage 1: If the attack
      causes damage, the victim's face is
      partially mangled and the victim takes a

STAGE IV: DRONE

How young adults, Stage IV Xenos are able
to adapt themselves quite elegantly in
surroundings made of stone and steel. With
polarized skin in their black in tone, they have a
hardened exoskeleton like full-grown adults.
They retain the enhanced blood vessel with a
burst to dispose smooth-domed heads. In
combat they show a keen preference, simply they
make any more set of claws that can strike like a
blade and tear through bone of allies.

DRONE PREDATORS: Smart, Cunning, Capable
hunters, if Drones are sure and confident in their
chance, they will not take unnecessary risks in
combat. Unlike the Warrior, Drones are keen
hunters that understand territory and the
strategic behavior also exhibited by Drones is
much to the effect. They are usually isolated
unless they were already very present it,
The solitary creatures fluid wet weakened movements and venomous acid splashes, the
creature remains relatively intelligent and
resourceful. It is said that the Drone can be
a clever yet single-minded iteration of the Xenomorph. Accompanied of demagogy and with
minimal intelligence, it is often too stupid
to do melt into a Warrior—chiefswhether
they are the first creatures to appear or if
they appear later, gather hosts for consuming, and sleep.
While these near, they are hungry in nature.

SILENT ASSASSIN: When making a Death
means roll on sneak attack from within the same
zone, the Drone is to alert that is target gets a
+2 modification to their observation roll.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION
PROTOCOL: Drones can be lured into traps
given their mind and are independent—stall each
one in isolation. They can be expelled from
locations and never used their life risk.
Drone are not above placing crude as humans
consider themselves, and will drag corpses
close to any lair accordingly.

THE XENOMORPH

DRONE ATTACKS

DS    ATTACK
1     HYPNOTIZING GAZE: The Xenomorph, eyeless as it may seem, stares deeply into the soul of its
      victim. The look is immediately accompanied by a dread beauty it seeks... try nearly as soon as
      actual nature is god or the alien has created, get a 0 stress level and must make an immediate
      Panic Roll.

2     TAIL WHIP: When the Drone attacks, but not to kill. The drone is attacking in the moment and
      drops all held-held items, but otherwise takes no damage. The Xenomorph stands over its
      victim, taunting its prey, and the creature can go on. The victim gets a 0 stress level.

3     DEADLY GAZE: The beast launches through the air, grabbing its victim. It attacks with ten
      Base Dice. If it hits, the victim immediately drops the object they were holding it, and the victim
      takes a Critical Injury Roll. The victim is prone, always all hand-held items and must make an immediate
      Panic Roll.

4     READY STANCE: The Xenomorph grabs its victim, its lower jaws shooting up so that the
      attack with ten Base Dice. If it hits, the victim counts as grabbed (see page 97) and needs to
      make an opposed roll Mobility check against ten Base Dice. If the victim loses the Opposed
      Roll, the creature can move the victim where it pleases. If it wins, the creature can attempt the
      attack again on the Xenomorph will use a FLANKER attack against them on its next Initiative.

      GRAPPLE: The Xenomorph grabs its victim, its inner jaws shooting out. This is different from the
      Deadly Gaze attack, in that the jaws are much more powerful and can crush armor and bone.
      Immediately it will be the victim at ten base, with armor rolled (the number of + rolled is the number of Rounds they can stay, then they
      roll and compare). The Xenomorph can break the grip and try to dash off if the victim's health is
      suffered below 1. If the victim determines the victim's health is damaged as described.

5     MEDICAL AID USING A MEDKIT:
      However, the Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws burst out,
      plunging in the victim before erupting forward. The attack has a range of three Base
      Dice. Damage 2: If it causes only damages to automatically inflicts Critical Injury #43: Inner
      Jaw Damage. 2: If the attack is a Critical injury, the victim may attempt to defend themselves and
      allow enough for the Xenomorph to initiate the exoskeleton process.

STAGE V: SOLDIER, WORKER

As the hive mind takes a hold of them at Stage V, the soldiers begin to grow from the Xeno's ebows, and its hands will morph their weaponry, something new and as unique weaponry. They are made and ready for attack on masse. The Soldier's tail has a barb at the end with a toxin that can cause paralysis in most creatures. These mighty creatures are large and will carry its prey back to the hive to be impregnated by a Facehugger.

DESTROYER OF WORLDS

WORKER: The biomechanical function and abilities of the Warrior form and the others of the kind are greatly different as humans, the humans seen are a weapon... The bodies are lumbered with a terrible case of this parasitic, leading them to a hive network of parasitic. Transformation creates a being that in its current form goes as humans would... In their role, they see the creatures they create as only Vessels, armies and destroys a hive, a hive of drones a hive, known mostly within the hive and

"They are the queen."
"What do you mean? They're only
parasites, right? They're soldiers!"

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION
PROTOCOL: At worst, the heavy bombardment of xenomorphs at the early beginning stages of the battle prevents of it It is possible to take out a squad of soldiers with proper equipment, but no two battles are fought symmetrically, the combat will be different.

      element within normal range, gels x 13 stress level.

2     SLASHING: The soldier at the largest group of enemies and roars a challenging, sweeping
      swipe with its claws. Make an attack roll with its opponent targets within x 12 dice, Damage 1. All targets
      at a MOBILITY roll or be knocked off their feet, taking one point of damage. All targets
      and may move 1 movement point.

3     TAIL JAB: The Xenomorph wrangles with its own tail. It attacks with twelve Base Dice. Damage 2. If the attack causes damage,
      the Xenomorph can immediately move or make an immediate Panic Roll. The victim in immediate danger gets a
      [illegible] roll of the victims.

4     CAPTURE AND BIND: The Xenomorph attacks with its venomous-salted tail, with twelve Base
      Dice. Damage 2: If the victim takes any damages, the Ape will to attempt to carry the victim
      away from the combat and hive immediately. The victim must make a Strength check versus
      rolling a DIFFICULTY roll if the victim is not immediately dropped. The number of + rolled is the number of Rounds the creature can carry it, and that
      can move. A strong opponent though, the paralysis can be removed with a shot of adrenaline.

5     EVASIVE ROAR THE GUARD: The Xenomorph desperately to protect its hive and drones, lunges towards
      its target with every intent to destroy. It starts at its to the attack with ten Base Dice, and the
      within unbiased range of the Xeno suffer an immediate acid splash attack of twelve Base Dice.
      Damage 2: Acid damage is acidic and deadly.

6     HEADBUT: The Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws burst out,
      plunging in the victim before erupting forward. The attack has a range of three Base
      Dice. Damage 2: If it causes any damage to automatically inflicts Critical Injury #43: Inner Jaw
      Damage. 2: If the attack causes damage, the victim on the deadliest blow.

STAGE VI: CHARGER, QUEEN

Stage VI: Xenomorphs are monstrous hyenas. Their immense size and crested carapaces mark
them as the leaders of their hive. Stronger and more intelligent than Warriors, they make an
independent command styles. These Stages are only in a couple during a typical colony instead
jelly and exposes her to violence in it.

CHARGER: Also called the Cruther, the Charger is the Xenomorph equivalent of a tank. After being called at her hive is a slaughtered creature. Blades will begin to grow from the Xeno's elbows, and its hands will morph their weaponry, something new and as unique weaponry. They are made and ready for attack on masse. The Soldier's tail has a barb at the end with a toxin that can cause paralysis in most creatures. These mighty creatures are large and will carry its prey back to the hive to be impregnated by a Facehugger.

STAGE VI: THE XENOMORPH
QUEEN: The pheromone-driven's hind see will not a fundamental, leaving their precision to maintain her and the hive, the pheromone-driven's hind and the hive's creatures, the Queen's carapace is armored enough to drown any land or and land army now. The Queen extends her control with an ability to communicate her hive. White evidence exists to suggest she does so primarily through pheromones, there can complete communication are now believed the Commander has.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION
PROTOCOL: Attempts to capture the Queen will likely result with her staggered head down. but its body is only as armored as that of a regular attacking creature and artillery will make short work of the Cruther. As far as combat, it seems she will call fire.

ROYAL JELLY
After xenomorphs are born in their genetic line, Royal Jelly is a parasitic element that is added to give birth to the matriarch Queen. Royal Jelly comes in a brood sac 50-56532-91-15 that includes an accelerated metamorphosis and is progenitive and M

"They grab the colonists, they move them over there and they immobilise them to be hosts for more of these. Which would mean that those places would be in a lot of these parasites, right? Do we stop him?"

"Yes, that follows."

"And each one of these things comes from an egg, right? So who's laying these eggs?"

"I'm not sure. It's got to be something we haven't seen yet."

4     REAPING ASSAULT: The Xenomorph opens its the eye, but the creature [illegible] suffered in the creature's ability can immediately triggers critical Injury #82, killing them outright.

THE ALIEN HIVE

An alien hive is a large Xenomorph XXXI nest, composed entirely of exotic and dangerous creatures. When you look at them and the nest and are standing on its own. Hives are full of field-covered chambers, tunnels, small chambers, in a vast lattice pattern with of Xenomorphs and the strange being carried by those. The Xenomorphs that the hive mold in cases of generation to sustain protective armor made of metal, an industrial base and the unique forms of metal to serve the production of eggs, as the creatures develop themselves inside the hive.

It's a nasty place and one you should avoid.

XENOMORPH XX121AB ABERRANT TYPES

There are many stages and subspecies of xenomorphs XX121—however, there are also mutations and aberrant forms of the creatures. Genetically distinct, these strange Xenomorphs are rare but far from unprecedented. This section examines a few of the variants encountered.

ARACHNID BODYBURSTER

A hybrid organism developed by Weyland-Yutani, the Arachnid Bodyburster is an insect-like creature that develops when a certain strain of Chemical Agent AG 9393-C3 is introduced into a host already carrying a Xenomorph XX121 embryo. Facehuggers. The accelerant acts as a genetic bridge between the two species, and the result of this unholy union emerges, reconstituting them into one or two separate creatures. The resulting hybrid is a six-legged arachnid creature (see page 72). Instead, this host undergoes a substantial metamorphosis and the Xenomorph XX121 becomes more insect-like, developing into a form more reflective of arachnid and arthropod biology. The transformation is so malicious that all present must make an immediate Panic Roll the first time they witness it. A fully formed Bodyburster resembles a large Xenomorph Drone with multiple legs. When it's time to burst from its host, the creature uses all six legs for disemboweling the face of the alien's smooth dome.

ALIEN ALLEGIANCE

All stages of Xenomorph XX121 seek to protect their hives and genetically programmed directives will not hesitate to attack someone who is already overpowered with a Xenomorph XX121 embryo. In an attempt to subdue the host instead—otherwise they will keep them alive. Pure Xenomorph XX121 clones and derivatives follow the same logic, hunting to protect enemies of the hive and seek to destroy them.

---PAGE 82 ---

BODYBURSTER ATTACKS

01 ATTACK: The Bodyburster leavers at a victim in a scurry range, staining them down with its empty egg sockets. The victim must make a Wits roll (the attribute only-no skill) and is not resistant be enhanced and immediately at the start of the next turn in melee range. Critical Injury and Massive Damage, as per close combat rules (page 72). If the victim and an Intensity (XP) is under range.

2 SPITTING: The Bodyburster whips unsecurity of the attack, this creature whips and writhes its head at the victim. The victim must make an Evasion test. If successful, the attack rakes the floor in an adjacent zone. The victim is prone, drops all hand-held objects, and most need an immediate action to recover from this surprise.

3 VENOMOUS FANGS: The Bodyburster strikes its fangs into its victim. The attack is rolled with Assault (Xenomorph) and Evasion (1). If it scores any damage this Xenomorph whirls and wracks and rattle the alien, attacking through Wounds (6-page 41). Alternatively, the creature-the tail attacks across the victim's abdomen. The attack is made with Assault (Weaponry) opposed by the victim's Athletics (1-page 72). If the attack scores any critical Injury (43) (even if the victim is not broken).

4 HEADBUTT: The Xenomorph strikes the victim by the head, if successful, the victim suffers damage equal to Armor (special) and is knocked back. The victim and an Intensity (XP) in under range.

5 HEADBUTT: The Xenomorph strikes with its outer jaw while, and the deadly inner jaws strike like a piston. The attacks is made with Close Combat (6-page 72). If it scores any damage it suffers a critical injury (43) (even if the victim's not broken). If it scores any damage it Inflicts an immediate Panic Roll for all Friendly PC's in melee range.

OIL-EATER BACTERIA

Originally developed by Weyland-Drilling Corp. to help clean up oil spills back in the 2100s, Alcatraz Containment is an artificially created bacterium. Unfortunately, the so-called "Oil-Eaters" got loose and spread across Earth. The bacterium consumed all forms of petroleum, multiplying and leaving only a corrosive acid residue in its place. It has become a counter-bacterium to kill it. Earth became reliant on nuclear and alternative energy technologies as oil-based technology had to become obsolete.

CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOLS: This shit gets everywhere. It consumes all forms of petroleum, multiplying and leaving only a corrosive acid residue. It has become a counter-bacterium to kill it. Earth became reliant on nuclear and alternative energy technologies as oil-based technology had to become obsolete and left everything in parks and get ready to move.

--- PAGE 83 ---

CARBON SILT EXPOSURE: The sparkling carbon silt waste left behind will fuck up your ride and turn on any spills. This silt and eye contact should not be allowed, as exposure amounts in the air are fine, but inhaling it directly and eye contact can cause severe lung hemorrhaging. There's exposure to the Silt and it soot dusts. PC is in a Tightly Turn, or after stimulated action, while the PC is exposed. The use of a molten musk gives a +2 modification to the aroma roll. In addition, see Harsh Exposure Tables One for any organism directly exposed to the carbon silt. On top of acidic exposure, the carbon silt needs to be fixed with a turn of work and a heavy machinery roll.

SILVER-LINING: Once altered by the StormPlague Gas, the Silth can become something other than acidic. Silth can be heavily altered (Virulence reduced by 2). Of course, that's only until altered OS-Eaters accumulate and set it back on course. Turns, turning it into something new (GM's discretion).

SILTY SYNTHETICS

A Synthetic is something that had the silt will affect their systems and parts as it would any other item. It I Synthetic becomes this corrosive and toxic, and...

TALENTS

COLONIAL MARINE TALENTS

BATTLE HARDENED: The scent of punching in the face of mortal danger, you can turn your fear into aggressive and use it as a weapon against your enemies. Once per round, when you roll Stress, instead of it as a weapon against your enemies. Once per round, when you roll Stress, instead of marking a Panic Roll—see page 31 in the core rulebook or page 70 in the Starter Set rules.

COMPANY AGENT TALENT
TAKE CONTROL: You know how to make a good show what you see and you don't hesitate, call a round out of others and stay THINK USING WITS instead of EMPATHY.

GENERAL TALENTS
DETERMINED: I propose not ONLY to take the hit, but for insanity. It doesn't count towards Critical Injury at all. Critical Injury is STILL rolled and, critically, you can push the roll instead.

OFFICER TALENT
FIELD COMMAND: Your command to give orders (page 7) in the core rulebook or page 42 in the Starter Set rules. When you give a Command, those in earshot can group up twice in a round.

FAST REFLEXES: You can draw one initiative card more and use it to shuffle the utter one back into the deck before drawing the other.

KILLER: You know where to strike to make your enemy fall just like that's when. When you switch the slide roll as that three times be-comes from sides and you wear this you can any any any any any any be used on humans.

WEAPON SPECIALIST: You're an expert at using a specific weapon type. Choose, a specific weapon type and gain a +1 to firearms and melee strikes. Any time you choose this talent several times, once per weapon type. You can be a specialist at multiple weapons.

--- PAGE 88 ---

APPENDIX IV:
VEHICLE COMBAT

A wide range of vehicles, both of the air and ground varieties, is available for purchase and deployment on the Frontier. You'll find a variety of ground and air vehicles available, all with different systems and capabilities. Driving under normal circumstances requires no dice rolls, but more advanced maneuvers require humans with Driving or Piloting, or piloting to be exact. Terrain, weather, and obstacles all affect the degree of difficulty.

VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES

PASSENGERS: The number of people that can travel within a vehicle, excluding the driver.

MANEUVERABILITY: The modifier you can add to your driving test when performing challenging maneuvers. Smaller, more nimble vehicles are higher. Larger, heavy ones.

SPEED: The speed of the vehicle, in number of zones per round per action.

ARMOR: The Armor Rating of the vehicle. Can take damage becoming wrecked.

VEHICLES IN COMBAT

To operate a vehicle in combat, you use the drive action. Driving 1st action takes up Straight Line. Steering requires one action. If you move multiple zones, this counts as a close combat attack. Don't forget the same action in combat.

ARMED VEHICLES: Some vehicles are filled with mounted heavy weapons, fired by the crew (not the driver). These are separate targets and have separate actions.

RAMMING ENEMIES: Most vehicles can be used as ramming weapons. You can attack a vehicle or enemy as a close combat attack, but roll for damage instead of close combat. Don't forget the same action in combat.

AERIAL VEHICLES

Aerial vehicles are handled in much the same way as ground vehicles, with some exceptions:

ALTITUDE: At all times you must keep track of your vehicle's altitude, measured in zones. When moving, you distribute the zones moved on vertical and horizontal. Speed divided by 2 equals the vertical speed or horizontal movement is moving.

CRASHING: If a vehicle suffers damage equal to the Armor at the altitude (in zones) multiplied by 5. You can brace yourself for the hit by rolling Athletics—each d6 rolled reduces the damage by one.

--- PAGE 89 ---

DAMAGE TO VEHICLES

Vehicles suffer damage just like people. Most vehicles can suffer Trauma Damage, Integrity loss. Each point of Integrity loss is Wrecked. This means the vehicle cannot go any further and will need to keep going lost.

CRITICAL HEAL: Vehicles don't suffer critical injuries when Wrecked. Instead, if they take damage equal to or higher than half their Hull Integrity in a single attack, one component takes damage. Roll on the table to the right. This means a vehicle can suffer component damage before being Wrecked.

REPAIRS

Repairing damage to a vehicle requires one or more mechanics to work together. A mechanic can attempt to make repairs using the rules for Effort or Difficulty based repairs. Unlike Damage, the cost of repair is based on Shifts. Only one person can call to repair the hull, but others can help. Each 8 shifted damage that the vehicle was Wrecked, this should be considered Wrecked and cannot be repaired easily.

COMPONENT DAMAGE: If the engine or a crucial component is damaged or destroyed, it typically requires a HEAVY MACHINERY roll, in addition to any roll for repairing hull damage. The work takes one Shift.

COMPONENT DAMAGE

| D6 | DAMAGE | EFFECTS |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1 | Driver Hit | The driver is hit and suffers damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. |
| 2 | Passenger Hit | A random passenger is hit and suffers damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If there are no passengers, re-roll. |
| 3 | Severe Spin | The attack rocks the vehicle. The driver must make an immediate check roll - all non-wrecked vehicles that the vehicle is wrecked. |
| 4 | Weapons Disabled | All mounted weapons mounted on the vehicle is disabled. Re-roll if no weapons are present. |
| 5 | Engine Disabled | The engine is disabled and the vehicle cannot move. Can move it a controlled landing, losing one zone of altitude per round. |
| 6 | Fuel | The engine explodes in a ball of flame. All people inside are immediately dead. Anyone in adjacent zones takes 8 damage. If the vehicle is destroyed completely. |

Space is vast, dark, and not your friend. Gamma
rays and neutrino bursts erupt from dying stars to
cook you alive, black holes tear you apart, and the
void itself boils your blood and seizes your brain.
Try to scream and no one can hear you—hold your
breath and you rupture your lungs.
Space isn't as empty as you’d think, either—its
frontiers are ever expanding. Rival governments
wage a cold war of aggression while greedy
corporations vie for valuable resources. Colonists
reach for the stars and gamble with their lives—
each new world tamed is either feast or famine.
And there are things lurking in the shadows of
every asteroid—things strange and different and
deadly.
Things alien.
This is the ALIEN roleplaying game—a uni-
verse of body horror and corporate brinkmanship,
where synthetic people play god while space
truckers and marines serve as hosts to newborn
ghoulish creatures.
It’s a harsh and unforgiving universe and you
are nothing if not expendable.
Stay alive if you can. ■

The titular alien—in all its iterations—is the stuff of
nightmares. From Neomorph to Xeno­morph, the
mystique surrounding these creatures is mesmer-
izing. The alien represents everything we don’t
understand about the natural world. It evokes a
fear of our bodies being violated and used. It is
a parasitic invader whose only intent is to use
humanity to breed and incubate its progeny. The
alien lifecycle is one of death and renewal, but the
only part people play in that circle is death.
But the ALIEN saga itself is about more than
otherworldly beasts. It is about humbling man
for his own hubris. It’s about motherhood and
family—about loss and sacrifice. It wrestles with
the questions of artificial intelligence and faith.
The story of ALIEN is about creators and their
creations struggling for dominance over each
other.
It’s about corporate greed and avarice, and
it’s about how superior firepower and fancy tech-
nology aren’t enough to protect you from the
horrors of the unknown. It’s about pushing the
envelope and sticking your nose where it doesn’t
belong, consequences be damned before they
damn you.
The ALIEN roleplaying game takes you to the
rough and tumble colony worlds on the Frontier
of known space. It’s on the cusp of this unfor-
giving place that your character must face their
demons—both of the inner and other kind. ■

There is nothing in the desert... and no man needs nothing.
— DAV I D  8 ,  P R O M E T H E U S
The Frontier begins on the leading edge of the
Outer Veil, crosses through the Outer Rim of the
known territories, and stretches on into deep
space. Located between the core systems and
the Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast region of
space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources.
The Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the
Colonial Navy operates there. Past the Outer Rim
is anyone’s guess—and that thrill of the unknown
is what draws pioneers here. Settlers have likened
the sometimes lawless Frontier to the Old West of
the United States.
Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds,
atmospheric processors have been brought in to
convert the air into something passably breath-
able. The majority of settlers here are prospectors,
entrepreneurs, farmers, and homesteaders. Mining
worlds refine ores and fuel, while agri and aquat-
ic worlds harvest food and algae. Space stations
such as Anchorpoint serve as a neutral staging
ground for expeditions into deep space.
Neighboring colonies don’t always get along,
and armed conflicts over stakes and claims are
not uncommon—often requiring the Colonial Ma-
rines to step in and restore order. The boundaries
of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and sometimes
colonies switch hands as border disputes rede-
fine the map.

While dominated by the United Americas, the
Frontier is an area intersected by several na-
tion-states. An uneasy alliance exists between
them, yet territorial disputes are not unheard of.
What follows is a listing of the major government
players vying for resources there.
THREE WO R L D  E M PI R E :  Consisting of
the former United Kingdom, Japan, and several
developing countries, the Weyland-Yutani corpora-
tion itself is a result of the formation of the Three
World Empire—created when the UK company
Weyland Corp merged with the Japanese Yutani
Corporation. The Three World Empire pioneered
space exploration, controls many long-established
inner colonies, and only maintains a limited pres-
ence on the Frontier—allowing Weyland-Yutani to
take the lead there.
THE UNITE D  A M E R I CAS :  Created in the
early 2100s to compete with the expanding Three
World Empire, the United Americas was formed
by the merger of North, Central, and South
America into one nation. The United Americas is a
major colonizing and starfaring power, constantly
expanding the Frontier. They operate both the
Colonial Marines and the Colonial Navy—the most
powerful peace-keeping forces on the Frontier.
T H E  U N I O N  O F  P R O G R E SSI V E
P EO P L E S:  The UPP is a powerful socialist
block of systems that control a vast but re-
source poor sector of space. Formed from a
coalition of countries that includes Russia and
Vietnam, the UPP is the only government that
is not influenced by corporate concerns—a fact
that sometimes puts them in opposition to
Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind in the
arms race, the UPP still maintains a formidable
fighting force. A state of cold war has existed
between the United Americas and the UPP for
decades, but with recent events on the Frontier,
all that seems poised to change.
T H E  I N DE P E N DE N T  CO R E
SYST E M CO LO N I E S:  The ICSC is a loose
conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each
colony in the ICSC has its own government—many
of which are corporate-owned. In addition to
its operations within the colonies of the United
Americas and the Three World Empire, Wey-
land-Yutani is known to maintain private interests
in the ICSC—where they can conduct business as
they see fit, far from the prying eyes of govern-
ment control.

While governments control the colonies, they
aren’t the only ones with influence there.
CORPORATE  D OM I NA N C E :  Although
nation-states dominate the stars, it is important
to note that the real power lies in the corpo-
rations that exist across them. Companies like
Weyland-Yutani, BioNational, and Seegson are
not limited by borders. In fact, they produce
and control the technologies necessary for
the continued existence of these star empires.
The unwillingness of nation-states like the UPP
to work with the private sector has left them
behind in the space race.
GOD  AT TH E  ASS  E N D  OF S PAC E :
Life in the colonies is rough. After being
promised a utopia, settlers instead found a
frontier existence of drudgery in harsh envi-
ronments. To that end, many have turned to
God to get them through their daily rigors.
While traditional religions are practiced
throughout the colonies, sects of apocalyp-
tic millenarian fundamentalists have arisen,
as have fanatical cults and zealots driven by
charismatic leaders in isolated areas. Recent
years have seen the rise of fledgling organi-
zations with questionable motives, such as
the Practitioners of the Holy Immolation and
the cultish Church of Immaculate Incubation.
“But how do you know? Hmm?”
“It’s what I choose to believe.”

Stories spread faster than light on the
Frontier. Some scouts tell tales of price-
less artifacts found in ancient ruins
on distant moons—ruins that predate
humanity by millennia. Others talk of
derelict spacecraft—and a race of giants
that once stalked the stars in them. Still
others whisper about hostile lifeforms
that overrun entire worlds—terrifying
parasitic creatures that are beyond our
comprehension and wholly alien.
Many believe Weyland-Yutani and
other corporations are covertly developing
new and dangerous biological weapons,
ranging from plagues and drug-controlled
psychopathic cyborgs to genetically-engi-
neered monsters. If these weapons really
are being developed, one has to wonder
who the company is designing them for,
and if a war is on the horizon.
Over the past century, ships, stations,
and even colonies have simply disappeared
from the Frontier. Some attribute these
losses to natural disasters or acts of God,
others believe those involved fell prey
to pirates or rival governments. Rumors
of entire colonies being wiped out by a
plague or nuked off the face of a planet
have everyone on the Frontier living on
the edge. Some even believe that man was
never meant to leave Earth, and that space
itself can swallow you whole.
Shutter your storm blinds and seal the
airlocks—something alien just might be out
there, hiding in the dark.
It’s waiting for you.

The year is 2183—little more than three years since
the destruction of the Hadley’s Hope colony on
LV-426, the disappearance of the USS Sulaco, and
the closing of the prison and lead works on Fio-
rina 161. The loss of the Sulaco’s Colonial Marine
unit along with these Weyland-Yutani sponsored
outposts, and the implications of corporate foul
play stemming from these incidents, have creat-
ed an air of distrust between the company and
the United Americas. Many Frontier worlds have
found themselves caught in the middle of this rift
and have been forced to make do without either
the supplies or defenses they need to survive.
CREW EX PE NDA B L E :  The only publicly made
exposition of these events deals only with the
aftermath on Fiorina 161. The book is titled Space
Beast and is convict Robert Morse’s alleged ac-
count of an alien “dragon” that overran the facility
and brutally slew two dozen double-Y chromo
inmates and their custodial staff.
The book gives credence both to talk of
monsters and to rumors of Weyland-Yutani experi-
mentation with bioweapons—indicating they were
more concerned about securing the creature for
further study than saving lives. According to Morse,
the hunt to capture the beast had spilled over from
the incident on LV-426, and anyone who got in the
Company’s way was expendable—be they prisoners,
soldiers, employees, or even colonists.
Although banned instantly, copies of Space Beast
have been transmitted illegally throughout the
colonies. The book has developed a strong follow-
ing. Some see it as a fantasy, a welcome diversion
from their normal lives. Others have embraced
Morse’s story and built a millenarian cult around
it—believing it to be a religious text and a portent
of the Armageddon to come.
T H I S T I ME  I T ’ S WA R :  To add fuel to the fire,
conflicts between the rival sectors of space have
increased exponentially in the past five years.
While unconfirmed, many believe that Hadley’s
Hope was a test site for one of Weyland-Yutani’s
bioweapons and that an enemy state sent a war-
ship to nuke it from orbit. Others believe that
the Company is working with a rogue nation to
assume control of the colonies on the Frontier.
As more and more Colonial Marine units are
recalled and re-deployed to new campaigns,
Frontier colonists are becoming scared. With-
out the military, there is no-one to protect
them from pirates, hostile lifeforms, or in-
vasion. To compensate, many colonies have
enacted their own law systems, electing Mar-
shals to oversee daily law enforcement. Some
have even hired mercenary forces to protect
their interests.
The 2180s are a dangerous time to be alive. ■

timeline
Following Peter Weyland’s infamous
Ted Talk address of 2023, Weyland
Industries begins developing new tech-
nologies that will catapult humanity
into the future. Projects in development
include advanced artificial intelligence,
FTL drives, atmospheric processors for
terraforming inhospitable worlds, and
hypersleep pods. Weyland produces the
first David series of androids.
Several small colonies begin to take hold
in the Outer Rim Territories, and the United
States begins work on a peacekeeping force
that will maintain order off-world. This
eventually leads to the formation of the
United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet
and later the Colonial Marine Corps. Wey-
land’s David Series Seven androids become
commonplace in the workforce.
Leading the technological revolution
with such companies as Weyland Corp
and the Yutani Corporation, the Three
World Empire is formed from the UK,
Japan, and other nations.
Weyland Corp launches the infamous USCSS
Prometheus on a mission to “find the origins of
humanity.” The ship is lost with all hands and pre-
sumed destroyed. With the death of both company
founder Peter Weyland and CEO Meredith Vickers,
the Weyland Corporation is left in financial ruin. By
the turn of the century, the company is bought out
and merged with the Yutani Corporation to form
Weyland-Yutani.
Terraforming operations begin
on Earth’s moon Luna. As faster
than light speed travel becomes
a reality, the Weyland Corpora-
tion launches the first FTL Space
Exploration vessel, the Heliades.
HD85512 B, Earth’s first off-world penal colony,
is established by the Weyland Corporation.
Prisoners from earthbound facilities are trans-
ferred there. Several other corporations begin
to capitalize on the space age. Corporate-run
mining colonies on the moons of Saturn and
Jupiter become a reliable source of the raw
materials necessary for FTL travel.
The UK and Japan pioneer the establishment of
settlements on Mars and Titan. Weyland Industries suc-
cessfully creates a breathable atmosphere on extrasolar
planet GJ667CC, opening a Pandora’s box of possibil-
ities for humanity to seed the stars. The Outer Veil, an
area of space hypothesized to be rich in minerals and
other resources, is discovered. The trailing edge of the
Outer Veil is where the Frontier begins.

Commercial towing vehicle USCSS Nostro-
mo departs Thedus for Earth. For reasons
unknown, the Nostromo sets down on LV-426.
The ship subsequently resumes course until
the engines are set to overload by the ship’s
third officer, again for reasons unknown.
The Nostromo’s flight recorder is salvaged and brought to Sevastopol Station.
The station is destroyed and it plummets into the atmosphere of planet KG348.
Mendel Station on the Outer Rim also disappears. Three years later, contact is
lost with Seegson Station LV 44-40 and the Wright-Aberra Waystation as well. In
response, the first Anchorpoint Station is established between the Core Systems
and the Outer Rim to allow for safe passage to and from the Frontier.
The Colonial Marines instate a draft on the
colonies. The Tientsin Campaign on the Frontier
world of 8 Eta Boötis A III is fought between the
United Americas and the Union of Progressive
Peoples. There is no decisive win for either side.
The Hadley’s Hope terraformed
colony is established on LV-426.
The new Anchorpoint Station is established. Tensions flare on
the Frontier as factions accuse each other of foul play during
the Hadley’s Hope incident. Robert Morse’s Space Beast
is transmitted throughout the colonies and subsequently
banned. Mistrust escalates as rumors of deadly alien life-
forms and company bioweapons spread across the Frontier.
The USCSS Covenant, Earth’s first long
distance, large-scale colonization effort,
is announced. The fanatical group
known as the Earth Savers repeatedly
fails to sabotage the Covenant mission.
North, South, and Central America unify
to form the United Americas. The Cove-
nant is successfully launched from Earth
orbit, carrying over 2,000 colonists and
embryos bound for planet Origae-6 in
the distant Sector 87.
Civil war breaks out on the colony
world of Torin Prime in the Outer
Rim Territories. At the resolution of
the two-year conflict, the planet is
reinstated into the United American
Colonies. Over fifteen thousand lives
are lost when the UAS troop carri-
er Archangel is destroyed during a
peacekeeping mission to Thedus. In
the wake of these conflicts, the Union
of Progressive Peoples is formed.
A shuttle from the long-lost Nostromo is recovered
by a deep salvage team. The colony on LV-426
stops communicating with Gateway Station. Co-
lonial Marines aboard the USS Sulaco are sent to
investigate. The Hadley's Hope colony is destroyed
in a thermonuclear explosion. The Sulaco goes
missing, but one of her EEV pods crashes on the
maximum security planet Fiorina 161. The facility
there is quarantined and shut down. There is one
survivor. The first Anchorpoint Station suffers a
catastrophic reactor meltdown and is destroyed.

To most, becoming a colonist means you
accept a hard life with little reward other
than the satisfaction of a job well done. A
colonist’s hands are always dirty and their
feet are always tired. Living on the edge of
civilization can have its benefits, however.
Depending on your profession, the chance
to strike it big could be right around the
corner. Frontier Colonists are scouts and
homesteaders, farmers and scientists,
miners and doctors. Colonial Marshals keep
the peace and Frontier journalists keep the
colonies in the know. Colonists are the life-
blood of humanity.
S P A C E  T R U C K E R S
While not as lucrative a field as it was some
fifty years ago, hauling refineries and cargo
between Earth and the colonies is still big
business. The advent of newer and faster
FTL drives has significantly shortened the
travel time between worlds, ensuring that
starship crews don’t have to spend nearly
as much time in stasis. Most companies
compensate their crews not only for their
work but for time lost in hypersleep as well.
While most space truckers work for
one corporation or another, there are also
independent trader captains, smugglers,
salvage crews, and privateers. Space is
big and, legally or off the books, people
and things always need to get from one
side of it to the other.
C O L O N I A L  M A R I N E S
The United States Colonial Marine Corps rep-
resents the finest fighting force ever assembled.
Technologically advanced and sporting all the lat-
est in military hardware—a large amount of which
is designed by Weyland-Yutani—the Colonial Ma-
rines are able to operate independently in nearly
any environment. Combat teams are cross-trained
and can be deployed at a moment’s notice to
nearly any world without extensive briefing.
Military occupations include vehicle oper-
ators and pilots, combat technicians, heavy
weapons specialists, medics, engineers, and
career officers. Naval occupations are found in
the USCM support service of warship and star-
fighter teams of the United Americas Outer Rim
Defense Fleet, and there are special military
R&D programs across the spectrum that require
volunteers. On the Frontier, there is always
something that needs defending and some
planet that needs pacifying.

Corporations have more power than govern-
ments on the Frontier. They own worlds, set up
shop, and bring in the colonists, creating homes
and jobs. From CEOs to field agents, each
company sends out its own representatives to
oversee their business ventures. Companies like
Weyland-Yutani have been known to employ
their own commando security teams, doctors,
and scientists as well.
Also, there is big business in knowing your
competitors' next move—so many corpo-
rations have their own counterintelligence
personnel embedded in rival companies and
governments. Being a company rep is all
about the art of the deal and making sure the
little people around you do their jobs so that
you can make your next promotion.  ■

Each player in this game—except one—takes the role of a player character (PC). You might be a space
colonist, a space trucker, a marine, or something else. You decide what your PC thinks and feels, what
they say and do—but not what happens to them.
It’s your job as a player to portray your PC and imagine yourself in their boots. Your PC is a per-
son with feelings and dreams, just like yourself. Try to imagine—how would you react if you were in
their place? What would you do?
The player characters are always the protagonists of the story. The game is about you. Your deci-
sions, your story.
T H E  G A M E  M O T H E R
The final player is the Game Mother, or GM
for short. She describes the ALIEN universe
to you. She portrays all the people and crea-
tures you meet during the game. Characters
controlled by the GM are called non-player
characters, or NPCs for short.
The game is a conversation between the
players and the GM, back and forth, until a
critical situation arises where the outcome
is uncertain. Then it’s time to break out the
dice—read more about this in Chapter 3.
It is the GM’s job to put obstacles in your
path and challenge your PCs, forcing them to
show what they’re really made of. But it is not
up to the GM to decide what happens in the
game—and above all, not how your story is
supposed to end. That is decided in the game.
That is why you are playing the game, to find
out how your story ends.  ■

A Cinematic scenario emulates
the dramatic arc of an ALIEN
film. Designed to be played in a
single session, this game mode
emphasizes high stakes and fast and brutal
play. Conflict between player characters
is likely, and you are not all expected to
survive. In fact, most of your PCs probably
won’t live to see the end of the scenario.
One such Cinematic scenario, Chariot
of the Gods, is included in this Starter Set.
This pre-generated scenario provides all
the tools necessary to run your first ALIEN
roleplaying game, and it’s a fun and easy
way to learn how to play and tell your own
stories on the Frontier.
More Cinematic scenarios will be pub-
lished by Free League Publishing in the
years to come.
C A M P A I G N  P L AY
Campaign play is designed
for longer continuous play
with the same cast of player
characters over several game
sessions, perhaps even dozens of ses-
sions. In Campaign play, you create your
own PCs, using rules found in the full
ALIEN roleplaying game core rulebook.
Campaign play can also be brutal and
deadly, but the chances for your PCs to
survive a night of play are generally high-
er than in Cinematic play.
In Campaign play, the narrative of the
game is to a higher degree controlled by
the GM and the players themselves. You
decide where to go and what to do, based
on who your PCs are and what they want.
The core rulebook supports three different
campaign frameworks:

T Space Truckers

T Colonial Marines

T Frontier Colonists
These campaign frames, and tools for
how to run them, can be found in the
core rulebook.
Sourcebooks and other supplements
for Campaign play will be published by
Free League in the years ahead. ■
The ALIEN roleplaying game can be played
in two distinct modes: Cinematic play and
Campaign play. These modes are each
designed to create a different experience
for you. Even some rules of the game only
apply to one of the two game modes—such
rules are marked with the symbol of each
game mode (see below).

No matter if you play cinematic or campaign play, any game of ALIEN is based on three key themes.
Most scenarios and campaigns contain a mix of these themes, but each scenario typically emphasizes
one theme more than the others.
S P A C E  H O R R O R
The ALIEN experience is rooted in a pervasive
darkness and tension, with a capacity to shock
by tapping into our primal fears. Every desperate
breath into the rebreather of your space suit may
be your last.
S E N S E  O F  W O N D E R
The ALIEN roleplaying game lets you discover strange worlds and ancient, incomprehensible artifacts
on a grand scale. Many ALIEN stories grapple with questions of humanity’s creation, destiny, and
place in the universe.  ■
S C I - F I  A C T I O N
Whether it’s on an intimate or sprawling scale,
roller coaster action—often with bloody re-
sults—is essential to many ALIEN stories. This
game includes robust mechanics designed for
fast and brutal combat.

In the ALIEN universe, nowhere is safe. Soon-
er or later, you will end up in situations where
the outcome is uncertain, no matter how
skilled you are. It’s time to break out the dice.
There are two types of custom six-sided
dice for this game: Base Dice (black) and
Stress Dice (yellow). Ten of each are included
in this boxed set. You roll the dice when you
perform a dramatic action that might deter-
mine if your PC lives or dies.
Both Base Dice and Stress Dice have the
 symbol on the 6 side. Rolling the
 sym-
bol usually means that an effect of some kind
is triggered, for example when succeeding
at using a skill. Stress Dice also have the
symbol on the 1 side. Rolling the
 symbol
triggers panic in your character. How all this
works in detail, you will learn in Chapter 3.

ROLLING DICE
The rules sometimes ask you to roll D6,
D3, 2D6 and D66. D6 means rolling a
Base Die and reading the number, ignor-
ing any symbols. D3 means you roll a D6
and divide the result by two, rounding
up. 2D6 means you roll two D6 and add
the results. Another type of roll is the
D66, which means you roll two D6s—
consider the first die as the tens digit
and the second die the ones digit. That
gives you a result between 11 and 66.
C A R D S
This boxed set contains two types of
custom playing cards. The ten numbered
initiative cards are used for drawing ini-
tiative in combat (see Chapter 4), while
the Personal Agenda cards are used in the
Chariot of the Gods scenario—if you are
player in the game, do not look at these
cards until instructed to do so by the GM.

If you have made your way here without know-
ing what a roleplaying game is, congratulations!
Welcome to a rewarding and creative hobby.
Roleplaying is a unique form of gaming, or cultural
expression if you prefer to call it that, that combines
tabletop gaming with storytelling. Roleplaying
games give you a set of rules and let you create
your own story with your friends in a way that
books, movies, TV, and even video games cannot.
The advantage of roleplaying games is
also their challenge—the freedom to create
the story yourselves can be overwhelming.
But this rulebook contains plenty of exciting
encounters, locations and characters that you
can populate your story with, and very specific
tools for the GM to use. If you need advice or
ideas, there is a forum for the ALIEN roleplay-
ing game as well as our other games on our
website, freeleaguepublishing.com.

Your player character (PC) is your most
important asset in the ALIEN roleplaying
game. They are your avatar on an ALIEN
world. They are your eyes and ears out there
in the deepest dark of space. You munch
on popcorn with friends and roll dice while
they take all the risks. There is an unwritten
binding agreement between you two, and
like any corporate contract, there is a catch.
You live vicariously through them, and they,
in return, depend on you to keep them alive.
Don’t screw it up. Take your PC serious-
ly. As far as you are concerned, they are a
real person—and their fate is in your hands.
No matter what you do, keep in mind your
character’s goals, hopes, and agenda. They
may differ from your personal beliefs, but
that’s ok—you’re playing a character and
this is a game. When a Xenomorph looms
over them, your character may be terri-
fied even when you aren’t. At all times, ask
yourself, “what would my PC do?” and have
them act accordingly.
Trust us, you’ll have more fun that way.
At the same time, don’t try to protect
your character from every conceivable
danger. The goal of any ALIEN game is
twofold—go on a suspense-filled thrill ride
and create a damn good story. For that to
happen you need to roll the dice, both figu-
ratively and literally. You need to take risks.
CHARACTER SHEET: To keep track of your
character's game stats, you need a char-
acter sheet. Five filled-in character sheets
are included in this boxed set, for use in the
Chariot of the Gods Cinematic scenario.
C I N E M A T I C  P L AY
In Cinematic scenarios, such as
the one included in this Starter
Set, the player characters are
already provided for you and the oth-
er players. All you need to do is decide
among yourselves who plays which char-
acter. There are usually more characters
available than the number of players—the
remaining characters become NPCs, run
by the GM. If you can’t agree on who to
play, roll dice for it.
C A M P A I G N  P L AY
For Campaign play, you create
your player character yourself. How
this is done is explained in the full
ALIEN roleplaying game core rulebook.  ■

A key aspect of your character is your career.
Your career determines your background and
your role in the group. Careers are described
in detail in the full ALIEN roleplaying game.
S K I L L S
Your skills are the knowledge and abilities you
have acquired during your life. They are import-
ant as they determine, along with your attributes,
how effectively you can perform certain actions
in the game. There are twelve skills in the game
and they are all described in detail in Chapter 3.
They are measured by skill level on a scale from
0 to 5. The higher the number, the better.
N O  SK I LL LE V E L?  You can always roll for
a skill even if you have no level in that skill. In
that case, you only use the associated attribute
plus any modifiers from relevant gear. Read
more about how skills work in the next chapter.
T A L E N T S
Talents are tricks, moves, and minor abilities
that give you a small edge. Each pre-generated
character included in this boxed set has a talent,
and a wide range of talents are included in the
full ALIEN roleplaying game.
A T T R I B U T E S
Your character has four attributes that indicate
your basic physical and mental capabilities, each
rated on a scale from 1 to 5. Your attributes are
used when you roll dice to perform actions in the
game, and determine how much damage you
can withstand before you become Broken. Read
more about this in Chapter 4.

T STRENGTH: Raw muscle power and brawn.

T AGILITY: Body control and speed.

T WITS: Sensory perception and intelligence.

T EMPATHY: Personal charisma and ability to
manipulate others.
C O R E  C O N C E P T S

PLAYING AN ANDROID
Androids are an important part of the ALIEN
roleplaying game, and you can play one as
your player character. Androids can have any
career and may be open about their nature or
secretly pose as humans. Rules-wise, androids
work a little differently from humans:

T Androids generally have higher STRENGTH
and AGILITY scores.

T Androids can’t push skill rolls (see page 34).

T Androids don’t suffer stress and thus don’t
have a STRESS LEVEL (see page 69).

T Androids never make Panic Rolls.

T Androids suffer damage differently (see
page 77).

sonal Agenda. How personal agendas work differs
between Cinematic and Campaign play.
CINEM AT IC  AG E N DAS : In Cinematic
play, the PCs’ Agendas are predetermined
by the scenario, such as Chariot of the
Gods included in this boxed set.
At the beginning of each of the three Acts of
the scenario, the GM gives each PC a card with a
new Agenda for the Act. The Agendas are hidden,
you should not show them to other players or
write them down on your character sheet.
At the end of each Act, the GM evaluates the
PCs’ actions. If you took specific actions to
further your Agenda during the Act, despite
personal risk or sacrifice, you are awarded one
Story Point. Story Points can be used to get
bonus successes in dice rolls (see page 35). Acts
and Personal Agendas are further explained in
the introductory scenario Chariot of the Gods.
C A MPA I G N  AG E N DAS :  How Personal
Agendas work in Campaign play is fully de-
scribed in the complete ALIEN roleplaying
game core rulebook.
S T R E S S
Life in space is lethal. More often than you’d
like, you’ll find yourself under extreme pres-
sure. In the game, this mounting tension is
represented by your STRESS LEVEL. It usually
starts at zero, and can increase by pushing
dice rolls (see page 34) and by experiencing
frightening or stressful situations. Stress is
explained further in Chapter 4.
H E A L T H
Even if you keep your nerves in check, chanc-
es are that sooner or later you’re going to get
hurt. This is tracked using your Health score.
You start the game with a number of Health
points equal to your STRENGTH score. Talents
can modify your maximum Health score.
S U F F E R I N G  DA MAG E :  When you suffer
damage, your Health score is reduced. This is
further explained in Chapter 4. If your Health
drops to zero, you are Broken and suffer a
critical injury (see page 65).  ■

The ALIEN roleplaying game is about a small
group of people facing unknown and horrifying
dangers in the cold darkness of space. To survive,
you need to find someone to trust, but also be
careful who you turn your back to.
In game terms, your PC can have one Buddy and
one Rival among the other PCs. You can only have
one of each. Your relationships are important for the
GM, as she can use them to create interesting situa-
tions in the game. In this Cinematic Starter Set, the
pre-generated character descriptions will indicate
any Buddy or Rival you have.  ■

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER
In the ALIEN roleplaying game, your PC can
end up in direct confrontation with another
PC. This is quite common in Cinematic play,
less so in Campaign play.
In Cinematic play, it’s up to the GM to call
out when a Player versus Player situation
escalates beyond the point of no return.
When the GM has “called PvP,” the players
involved play out the current conflict to
its conclusion. After that, the PC who has
“turned traitor,” if they are still alive, be-
comes an NPC and is from now on under the
control of the GM. The player in question
is given a new PC to play, if one is avail-
able. This means that you should think very
carefully before acting against the common
interests of the group, even if you think it’s
in line with your Agenda—it may cost you
your PC. You are strongly recommended to
wait until the third and final Act of the sce-
nario before taking such drastic action.
In Campaign play, PvP is less common and
any such situations are resolved in the group
without specific rules—you’ll just need to
work out your differences if you are to con-
tinue in the same crew of PCs.

To survive the world of ALIEN, you need the right
gear. An M314 Motion Tracker, an Mk.50 Compres-
sion Suit, or an M41A Pulse Rifle can truly mean
the difference between life and death for your
character. You can find these items and plenty of
other gear described in Chapter 5.
You must write down all the items you are car-
rying on your character sheet. Write down one
item per row in the Gear section on the sheet.
If it’s not listed on your sheet, you don’t have it
with you.
In Cinematic play, the scenario determines
what gear you start the game with.
S IGNATURE IT E M : In addition to your normal
gear, you also have a signature item—a small item
that’s not of much practical use, but that has senti-
mental value to you and that says something about
your character. Common examples include a patch,
a cap, or a photo of a loved one.
Once per Act in Cinematic play, and once per
game session in Campaign play, you can interact
with your signature item in some way to reduce
your STRESS LEVEL (see page 69) one step.
Signature items are usually tiny (see next page)
and thus don’t encumber you at all.
V E H I C LE S  &  SPAC E SH I P S :  In some Cine-
matic scenarios, your PCs have a vehicle or even
a spacecraft. Usually, vehicles and starships don’t
belong to one individual character—instead, they
are crewed by the entire group of PCs together.
In Campaign play, it’s also possible for your
group to start out the campaign in possession
of a vehicle or a ship. This is explained in the full
ALIEN roleplaying game core rulebook.

WHEN TO MAKE SUPPLY ROLLS
How often you should make Supply rolls depends on the consumable in question, and the overall
situation. The intervals in the table below should be seen as guidelines for the GM.
CONSUMABLE
SUPPLY ROLL
Air
Every Turn (see page 49), and after every strenuous activity like combat or a
MOBILITY roll.
Water
Once per day, and after every strenuous activity like combat or a MOBILITY roll.
Food
Once per day.
Power
Situational, depending on the gear used. See Chapter 5.

In the world of ALIEN, you need to overcome
a lot more than Xenomorph life forms to
survive. Lack of air, food, water, and electric
power can be just as deadly. These four re-
sources are called consumables.
You don’t need to track consumables at all
times. In the confines of a functional space-
ship, orbital station or planetside colony, you
likely have the consumables you need. The GM
lets you know when resources are scarce and
it’s time to start tracking them.
SUPPLY: You track each of the four consum-
ables on your character sheet using a Supply
rating. A higher rating is better.
At regular intervals (see the table on the
previous page), you need to make a Supply
roll. This means rolling a number of Stress
Dice equal to the current Supply rating, up to
a maximum of six dice. For every
 rolled,
the Supply rating is decreased by one. When
the Supply rating reaches zero, you’re out of
the consumable, and you’re entering a world
of hurt. The effects of lacking air, food and
water are explained in Chapter 4.
GROUP CONSUMABLES: Usually, consumables
are tracked individually, but they can also be
tracked for the group as a whole, depending
on the situation. The GM has final say.
ENCUM BRA N C E :  For encumbrance, your
supplies of food and water count as one item
each, as long as your current Supply rating is 4
or lower. See the table to the right. When your
Supply rating hits zero for food or water, this
consumable no longer encumbers you.
Air and power don’t usually count toward
your encumbrance, as they are generally includ-
ed in your pressure suit or other gear. External
air tanks or batteries can count as encumbering
items however. Read more in Chapter 5.
E N C U M B R A N C E
You can carry a number of regular-sized items
equal to double your STRENGTH rating without
problems. A regular item is generally the size of a
small bag and weighs no more than a few kilos.
H E AVY  &  LI G H T  I T E MS:  An item desig-
nated as heavy counts as two regular items,
and typically takes up two rows on your char-
acter sheet. Some heavy items count as three
or even four normal items—the gear lists in
Chapter 5 of this book indicate this.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, there
are items that are designated as light—they
count as half of a regular item, and so you can
list two light items on one row on your sheet.
Some light items count as a quarter of a nor-
mal item in terms of encumbrance—the weight
of such items is written as ¼ in the gear lists.
T I N Y  I T E MS :  Items that are even smaller
than light items are called tiny. They are so
small they don’t affect your encumbrance at
all. The rule of thumb is: if the item can be
hidden in a closed fist, it’s tiny. Tiny items also
need to be listed on your character sheet.
OV E R - E N C U MB E R E D :  You can temporar-
ily carry up to twice your normal encumbrance
limit, i.e. STRENGTH x 4 items. If over-encum-
bered, you must make a MOBILITY roll when you
want to run or crawl in a Round of combat
(see page 55). If you fail, you must either drop
what you are carrying, or stay put.  ■

There are twelve skills in total in the game,
all described later in this chapter. Three skills
are connected to each of the four attributes:
STRENGTH, AGILITY, WITS, and EMPATHY. Skills are
measured in skill levels, from 0 to 5.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, two types of
six-sided dice are used in this game, each
available for purchase separately: Base Dice
and Stress Dice. You can play this game with
any normal six-sided dice, but it helps if you
have them in two different colors to tell Base
Dice and Stress Dice apart.
ROLLS WITHO U T  S KIL L :  If you don’t
have the skill required for the particular action
you want to perform, you can roll anyway—
simply roll a number of Base Dice equal to
your attribute as well as any Stress Dice.
 M E A N  S U C C E S S
When you use a skill, first describe what your
character does or says. Then, add your skill
level to your score in the attribute connected
to the skill, and grab that many Base Dice. If
you have Stress Dice (below), add these to the
dice pool as well.
Then just roll all the dice together. For your
action to succeed, you must roll at least one
 symbol (a six)—if not, your action fails. If
you roll more than one
, you can perform
stunts (listed under each skill description).
T H E
 SY MB O L: On the Stress Dice, the
1 is replaced by the
 symbol. If you roll one
or more
 you risk panicking. Read more on
page 70.
Roleplaying is an intimate conversation. The GM
sets the scene, you describe what you do, she
tells you how the NPCs react, you respond, and
so on—back and forth. The story grows one step
at a time, and everyone lives happily ever after.
Yeah, just kidding about that last part. Not
on the Frontier, you don’t.
Sooner or later, the shit—just like prisoner
Murphy—hits the fan. Things come to a head,
a point of no return is reached, and a problem
mounts that cannot just be settled by talking
your way out of it.
That’s when you call upon your mad skills.
Just break out the dice and show Mother you
know a thing or two.  ■

If you don't roll any
, something goes
wrong. For some reason, you failed to
achieve your goal. Feel free to elaborate on
why with the help of the GM. She might even
let a failed roll have further consequences to
move the story forward in a dramatic way.
Failure must not stop the story complete-
ly. Even when you fail, there must be a way
forward—perhaps at the cost of time, risk, or
UA dollars, but still a way. The GM has the fi-
nal say on the consequences of failure in any
particular situation.
You have one last chance if you really
want to succeed—you can push the roll.

If you are desperate to succeed with a dice
roll, you can choose to push the roll. This
means that you grab all the dice that didn’t
show
 and roll them again. You get a new
chance to roll
.
Usually, you would only push a roll if you
failed it, although you can push your roll
even if you rolled
 first, to get more
 to
increase the effect of an attack, for example.
Pushing a roll is not without risk, as it increas-
es your STRESS LEVEL; more on that below.
O N LY  O N C E :  You can only push your roll
once. If you don’t succeed on your second try,
you just have to deal with the consequences.
Some talents can allow you to push certain rolls
a second time, however.

DESCRIBE YOUR ACTION
You create a story together in the ALIEN role-
playing game. A dice roll is a dramatic high
point. First you describe what you are trying to
achieve, so that everyone knows what is at stake.
Then you roll your dice. Interpret the result and
describe what happens. Describe what you do,
what you say, or what you are thinking. If you
push your roll, describe how. Do it yourself, don’t
wait for the GM—the GM should only stop you if
you go beyond the results you have rolled.

P A N I C
Pushing dice rolls is a little like playing
blackjack—it increases your chances of
success, but if you push too hard, you
suffer the consequences. In the ALIEN
roleplaying game, these consequences are
triggering panic and losing control of your
character.
When you roll Stress Dice in a skill roll
and one or more
 symbols come up, you
cannot push the roll—instead, you must im-
mediately make a Panic Roll (see page 70).
A Panic Roll can cause your skill roll to fail
no matter how many
 you rolled.
Besides pushing skill rolls, other stress-
ful or dangerous events can increase your
STRESS LEVEL as well as trigger Panic Rolls.
AMMO: If your action is firing a weapon with
a limited magazine, rolling one or more
 means that you empty the magazine in
addition to making a Panic Roll. Read more
about ammunition on page 62.
S T R E S S  L E V E L
Pushing yourself builds tension to a point
where you risk going into wild panic or a
violent outburst. When you push a roll, your
STRESS LEVEL immediately increases by one
point. Mark this down on your character sheet
before you re-roll your dice.
When making skill rolls—including the im-
mediate re-roll when pushing—add a number
of Stress Dice to your dice pool equal to your
current STRESS LEVEL. This means the stress ac-
tually increases your chances to succeed at skill
rolls—it makes you more sharp and alert. How-
ever, if you roll a
 symbol on one or more
Stress Dice during a skill roll, you risk panic.

DON’T ROLL TOO OFTEN
In the ALIEN roleplaying game, a dice roll is
a dramatic moment. Pushing rolls increases
stress and can trigger panic in your character.
Rolling dice too often can cause the stress me-
chanic (see page 69) to spiral out of control
too quickly. With that in mind, never roll dice
unless it is absolutely necessary. Save the dice
for dramatic situations or tough challenges. In
any other situation, the GM should simply al-
low you to perform whatever action you wish.

STORY POINTS
In a Cinematic scenario, you can spend a Story
Point to get one automatic
 in a dice roll. You
can spend the Story Point after a failed roll, or
even after a successful roll in order to get an ex-
tra
. You gain Story Points by following your
Personal Agenda (see page 26). You can never
have more than three Story Points, however.

O N LY  O N E  C H A N C E
As a rule, you only have one chance to suc-
ceed with any action. Once you have rolled
the dice—and pushed the roll—you can’t roll
again to achieve the same goal. You need
to try something different or wait until the
circumstances have changed in a substantial
way. Or let another player character try. This
rule does not apply to combat, where you can
attack the same enemy over and over until it is
dead on the floor.
M O D I F I C A T I O N
Sometimes, external factors help you to suc-
ceed. This gives you extra Base Dice to roll.
Other times, something hampers your action.
This gives you fewer Base Dice to roll than
normal. This is called a modification. Modifica-
tion +1 means you roll one extra Base Die, +2
means you roll two extra Base Dice, and so on.
Modification –1 means you roll one Base Die
fewer than normal, –2 means two fewer, and
so on.
Several modifications can apply to the
same roll, simply add them together. A modifi-
cation of +2 and one of –1 add up to +1. If you
don’t have enough Base Dice to remove after
a modification, remove Stress Dice. If you end
up with no dice at all, you have no chance to
succeed at this action—time to rethink your
strategy!
You can get modifications in several differ-
ent ways:

T Gear (see Chapter 5)

T The difficulty of the action itself

T Help from others
G R O U P  R O L L S
When you face a challenge together with the
other PCs, don’t roll dice separately. Instead,
you choose who among you is best suited to
take on this challenge. The others may help
them (see next page) if it’s relevant to the
situation. If the roll fails, it counts as a failure
for all of you—you are not allowed to try one
time each.
This rule does not apply in combat, where
each PC is free to attack any enemy they like.

NPCS AND PUSHING
As a general rule, NPCs never push rolls and
they don’t have a STRESS LEVEL. Instead, the GM
determines when NPCs panic.

NPCS AND SKILLS
Non-player characters use skills in the same
way as player characters, with the one major
difference being that NPCs never push rolls.
The GM rolls dice for NPCs, but should only
roll for actions that affect a PC directly—for
example, if the NPC is attacking a player char-
acter or is attempting to save them. When an
NPC performs an action that does not directly
affect a PC, the GM can simply decide what
happens, without rolling dice.

Normally, the GM doesn’t assess how difficult
an action is. You only roll dice in challenging
situations—period. But sometimes, the GM
might want to underscore that external factors
either help or hinder an action. Use the table
to the right for guidance.
There are also cases when modifications
are imposed by the rules, like when you aim
carefully with a ranged weapon (see page 60),
shoot at long distance, or if you’re in a bad
bargaining position when you attempt to use
MANIPULATION on someone. Some talents can
also give you a positive modification in certain
situations.
H E L P  F R O M  O T H E R S
Other PCs or NPCs can help you succeed at
a skill roll. This must be declared right away,
before you roll your dice. It must also make
sense in the story—the individual helping
you must have the capacity to support your
action. The GM has the final say.
For each person helping you, you get a +1
modification. No more than three people can
help you with a single roll, meaning your maxi-
mum modification from assistance is +3.
In combat, helping counts as the same type
of action as the one you are supporting (fast
or slow, see page 53).
NPCs can help each other in the same
way as player characters. Letting NPCs act
in groups instead of individually is often an
easy way to manage large numbers of NPCs
in conflicts.

Sometimes rolling a
 isn’t enough to suc-
ceed with your skill roll. In some cases, you
have to beat your foe in an opposed roll. To win
an opposed roll, you have to roll successfully
and roll more
 than your adversary. Every

Only you (the attacker) can push your roll.
Sometimes you and your adversary roll for
different skills, sometimes the same. Opposed
rolls are common when you MANIPULATE or use
MOBILITY to sneak, and when someone uses
those skills against you. The GM can also use
opposed rolls when she deems it appropriate,
like rolling STAMINA vs. STAMINA to determine

you want to get out of a hazardous situation—be it
a risky climb, a dangerous jump, or sneaking past
a lurking enemy. When MOBILITY is used for stealth,
make an opposed roll against your opponent's

T You knock or pull a weapon or other object
from your opponent. You choose which. During
combat, picking up a dropped object counts as
a fast action (see page 53).

T Your opponent is knocked to the ground.

T You hold your opponent in a grapple. They
need to win an opposed CLOSE COMBAT roll
against you to break free, and can’t perform
any other action until they have done so, or
until you are Broken or let them go. This effect
only works on humans and synthetics.

( E MPAT H Y )
Alien life forms may gut you without remorse,
but the most truly dangerous beings in the
ALIEN universe are corporate agents and
other schemers who use lies, threats, or subtle
persuasion to get what they want.
To make another person see things your
way, make an opposed roll for MANIPULATION
(it takes a liar to spot a liar). Your chances are
affected by your negotiating position (see the
boxed text on the next page).
FA I LU R E :  Your adversary won't listen and
won't do what you want. They might start to
dislike you, or even attack you if provoked.
SU CC E SS :  If you succeed, your adversary
must either do what you want or immediately
attack you physically. Even if your adversary
chooses to do what you want, they can still de-
mand something in return. The GM decides what
that entails, but it should be reasonable enough
for you to be able to meet those demands. It is
up to you to accept the agreement or not.
ST U N TS :  For each
 you roll in excess of
what you need to win the opposed roll, you
can choose one of these stunts:

T Your opponent does what you want with-
out demanding a favor in return.

T Your opponent does more than you ask for,
for example giving you some useful piece
of information. Details are up to the GM.

T Your opponent is impressed by you and
will try to help you later on in some way.
Details are up to the GM.
B E I N G  MA N I P U LAT E D :  NPCs and other
PCs can use MANIPULATION on you. If their roll
succeeds, you must attack or offer a deal of
some kind. Then it is up to the GM (or the other
player) whether your adversary accepts or not.

MANIPULATE A GROUP
When you want to manipulate a whole
group, you usually address the group’s
leader or spokesperson. Note that you get a
–1 modification to your roll if your opponent
has more people on their side. If you reach
an agreement with the leader, the rest of
the group usually follows. If there is no giv-
en leader it’s harder—every single opponent
acts individually.
S U R V I V A L  (WITS )
Terraforming can make the atmosphere on
alien worlds (passably) breathable, but it will
rarely make them earthlike. You might be able
to breathe without a pressure suit on such
worlds, though you can also expect to struggle
against extreme heat and cold, sandstorms,
acid rain, and other extreme weather. Roll for
SURVIVAL when you’re in a hazardous planetside
environment of some kind and need to figure
out a way to stay alive.
FAILURE: You find no safe haven. Unless
someone comes to your rescue, you're on
borrowed time.
S UCCESS: You find a safe haven to weather
the storm.
STUNTS: For every extra
 you roll, choose
one stunt applicable to the situation:

T Give one
 to another PC in the same
trouble as you.

T Gain a +1 modification to a later skill roll
relating to this one.

If you are to survive the horrors of
space, you’ll need a good leader—or
you must become one yourself. You can
use your COMMAND skill in two ways:
STOP PANIC: When another character
makes a Panic Roll and loses control,
you can make a COMMAND roll to return
them to their senses. See page 70.
G I V E  O R D E R S :  In combat, as a slow
action you can bark orders to another
character. They must be able to hear
you, even if via a comm radio. Roll
COMMAND. For every
 you roll, they
get a +1 modification to their roll when
carrying out the order you gave.
O F F I C E R S:  PCs with the Officer
career and the Pull Rank talent can use
COMMAND to order other characters (PCs
and NPCs) to do as they say.  ■
M E D I C A L  A I D
( EMPATHY )
In the world of ALIEN, there is a significant risk that
you or the other characters will be injured, sooner or
later. This is when the MEDICAL AID skill is useful. It can
be used in two different ways:
RECOVERY:  A person whose Health has dropped
to zero is Broken. If you apply your MEDICAL AID
skills to them and your roll succeeds, they get back
on their feet and immediately recover a number of
Health points equal to the number of
 you rolled.
Read more about damage in Chapter 4.
SAVE A LIFE :  The most critical use of MEDICAL
AID is saving the life of a fallen character who has
suffered a critical injury. A failed roll at this point
could mean the end for your patient, so be careful!
Read more about critical injuries on page 65.

NEGOTIATING POSITION
Your chances of using MANIPULATION on someone suc-
cessfully are affected by your negotiating position,
which is determined by the GM. Each of the following
factors gives your roll a +1 modification:

T You have more people on your side.

T What you ask for doesn’t cost your opponent
anything.

T Your opponent has suffered damage.

T You have helped your opponent previously.

T You present your case very well (determined by
the GM).
Each of the following factors modifies your roll by –1:

T Your opponent has more people on their side.

T You ask for something valuable or dangerous.

T Your opponent has nothing to gain by helping you.

T You are having trouble understanding each other.

T You are talking via radio or shouting at a distance.

NOT MIND CONTROL
When you use MANIPULATION on some-
one, you don’t take control of their
mind. What you are trying to convince
your adversary to do must be some-
what reasonable, otherwise the GM can
disallow it.

M A P S  &  Z O N E S
A conflict in the ALIEN roleplaying game
is typically played out using a map of the
starship, colony, or whatever location your
characters happen to find themselves fighting
for their lives in.
The map is divided into zones. A zone
is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of
ground. How big a zone is varies—from a few
steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is
generally smaller in a cramped environment
than in open terrain. In official scenarios and
other material for this game, zones are usually
indicated on a location map. In random en-
counters created on the fly, the GM can make a
quick sketch of the area or simply describe it.
Fight or flight? That’s the big question, now,
isn’t it?
You may feel invincible tucked away behind your
cozy character sheet, but your PC is out there on
the line—and they are damn well mortal. Remember
back in Chapter 2 when we told you not to get your
character killed? Consider this your second warning.
Often, it’s a better bet to run away and fight
another day—assuming you’re fast enough to es-
cape whatever thing is nipping at your heels. Often,
its best to just meld into the shadows and be all
quiet-like. Before releasing the safety on your pulse
rifle, always ask yourself—is it worth it?
Sometimes you have no choice. Sometimes
that alien thing you thought was right behind you
is already waiting for you in that dark corner you
thought was safe.
Just coming face-to-face with an alien monstros-
ity can turn your mind to jelly. You may only have a
split second before the beast dismembers you and
crushes your skull.
And alien species aren’t the only danger.
People on the Frontier are jerks. Sometimes,
someone just sticks a gun in your face. When
backed against a wall, you damn well better fight.
When someone or something comes for you, you
need to be able to defend yourself.
Here’s how.  ■
T I M E  &  S P A C E

PLAYING WITHOUT MAPS
Although maps can be useful, you can al-
ways choose not to use them and let certain
conflicts play out only in the “theater of the
mind.” This can be a good solution in close
quarters conflicts between a small number of
combatants.

The border between two adjacent zones can
be open or blocked (by a wall or bulkhead).
A blocked border can have a door or a hatch,
as indicated by the map, allowing movement
between the two zones.
Open borders don’t block vision or move-
ment. A blocked border generally blocks
line of sight even if there is a door or hatch
in it—unless you’re actively standing by the
doorway and peeking through.
M E A S U R I N G  T I M E
In the ALIEN universe, time matters. Wheth-
er you are awaiting rescue on an alien world
with Xenomorphs stalking you, or Mother is
counting down to the imminent destruction
of your ship, you need to keep track of time.
There are three separate units of time used
in this game, depending on the situation at
hand. See the table below.
The exact duration of a Round, Turn and
Shift can vary depending on the situation.
It’s the GM’s job to track time and determine
when another Round, Turn or Shift has passed.
There are typically four Shifts in a day: Morn-
ing, Day, Evening, and Night.
Z O N E  F E A T U R E S
Zones can have various features, which affect
actions performed within them. Here are some
examples:
C LU T T E R E D :  The zone is filled with debris
or machinery. You must roll MOBILITY when
you move into the zone (see page 55). Failure
means you manage to get into the zone, but
you fall down.
DARK: The zone is dimly lit. OBSERVATION rolls
in the zone get a –2 modification. Ranged
attacks into the zone also suffer a –2 modifi-
cation, and can’t pass through the zone.
C R A MP E D :  A crawlspace or narrow tunnel.
In a cramped zone, you can only crawl, not run
(see page 55). You also cannot move or shoot
past individuals next to you against targets
behind them.  ■

RANGE CATEGORIES
The distance between you and your oppo-
nents is divided into five range categories. See
the table below.

In the ALIEN roleplaying game, much of the
thrill happens before the enemy shows itself and
bullets start flying. A key part of the experience
is exploring unknown locations, with enemies
lurking in the darkness. In the game, this is rep-
resented by what we call stealth mode. Stealth
mode is played out in Turns.
In one Turn, you can move two zones on the
map and explore them, scanning for enemies and
getting a superficial description of these two
zones from the GM. If you’re a team, you can ex-
plore the map individually or as a group.
If you want to examine something in a zone
more closely, such as accessing a data terminal,
you need to stay one entire Turn (or even longer)
in a single zone. The GM has final say.
S T E A L T H  M O D E
E N E M Y  M O V E M E N T
In stealth mode, enemy movement is handled
secretly by the GM. This is carried out each Turn,
after your PCs have moved. NPCs must comply
with the same rules of movement as PCs—hu-
man NPCs can only move two zones per Turn.
Non-human characters may move faster or have
other special rules.
To handle NPC movement, we recommend
that the GM has a second copy of the conflict
map, hidden from view by the GM Screen
(available for purchase separately). On this
map, the GM can place tokens to represent
NPCs, hidden from the players’ view.
If your GM doesn’t have access to a
screen, she can simply track hidden NPC
movement on a piece of paper.
ACTIVE AN D  PASS IV E  E N E M IE S :
Enemies can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE, as dictated
by the scenario or the GM. ACTIVE enemies are
aware of you and are actively stalking you.
PASSIVE enemies are not aware of your pres-
ence and can be ambushed by you.
D E T E C T I O N
In stealth mode, you will automatically detect
PASSIVE enemies in the same zone or in line of
sight (above). If you make no attempt to move
quietly, PASSIVE enemies will automatically
detect you as well—draw initiative (see page
53). If you want to sneak past the PASSIVE en-
emies undetected or make a sneak attack, roll
for MOBILITY against their OBSERVATION. You get
a modification based on the distance to the
enemy—see the table on the next page.
ACTIVE enemies nearby may try to sneak
up on you for a sneak attack. If so, the GM
informs you that a threat is moving in on you,
and then rolls MOBILITY for the enemy against
your OBSERVATION. If you fail, the enemy gets
a free attack against you. Read more about
sneak attacks on page 56.
You cannot spot ACTIVE enemies that
choose to remain hidden and don’t attack
you—unless you have detected them using a
motion tracker first, or the GM deems it obvi-
ous that you spot the enemy (for example, if
you search the exact spot where it is hidden).

M O T I O N  T R A C K E R S
A useful piece of gear in stealth mode is a mo-
tion tracker, such as the M314 unit (see page
98). You can use a motion tracker once per
Turn, and each time you use it you must make
a Power Supply roll (see page 29).
The tracker will automatically detect the
presence of any large moving objects within
LONG range (up to four zones) indoors and EX-
TREME range outdoors, and let you know which
zone they are in. We recommend that you mark
the “ping” of movement from a motion tracker
by placing a token of some sort on the map.
Note that the motion tracker will only
detect moving objects—if the GM determines
that your enemy stays still, it won’t register.
Detecting an enemy with a motion track-
er doesn’t mean you have spotted it and can
engage it in combat—for that, you need to be
in the same zone as the enemy or have line of
sight to it. If the enemy is small or well hidden,
the GM can also have you make an OBSERVA-
TION roll to spot it.  ■

MAP MARKERS
If you like, you can use markers to represent
movement on the map, as well as “pings”
from a motion tracker. Such markers are
included in the Maps & Markers Pack for the
ALIEN roleplaying game, which will be avail-
able for purchase separately.
When the enemy is revealed, stealth mode is over
and actual combat starts. Stop counting Turns
and start counting Rounds. The first step is to
determine who has the initiative. Do this before
anyone rolls dice for an action (except for sneak
attacks, see page 56).

T H E  I N I T I A T I V E
Grab ten cards, numbered 1 through 10. In the
custom card deck for the ALIEN roleplaying
game (sold separately), there are ten special
initiative cards to use when drawing the initia-
tive. If you do not have access to the custom
card deck, a normal deck of cards works fine,
with the ace counting as the one.
All the players taking part in the conflict—
whether voluntarily or involuntarily—each draw
a card and the GM draws one card for every
NPC. This is called drawing the initiative. The
number on the card determines the order in
which you act in the conflict, lowest to highest.
Number 1 acts first, number 2 acts second,
and so forth until everyone has acted. Place
your initiative card by your character sheet, so
everyone can see in which order you act. The
GM puts her initiative cards in front of her.
When all the participants in the combat
have acted once, the Round is over, and a new
Round begins. The Round order remains the
same throughout the whole conflict—drawing
the initiative is only done once, at the start of
the first Round.
C H A N G I N G
T H E  I N I T I A T I V E
You never draw a new initiative card during
a fight, but you can exchange your initiative
card—and thus your initiative for the Round—
with another player character. This can be
done at the start of the fight or at the start
of the Round, but never during a Round. You
and the other player character must be able to
speak to each other to exchange initiatives.
S L O W  &  F A S T  A C T I O N S
When it is your time to act in the Round, you can
perform one slow action and one fast action, or
two fast actions. A slow action usually consists
of rolling for a skill. A fast action is quicker and
doesn’t always require rolling dice, though it
might. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions
on page 54. How these work is explained in detail
in the sections Ranged Combat and Close Combat.
D E S C R I B E  YO U R  AC T I O N S . When it’s your
time to act, simply state which two actions
you wish to perform, describe how you go
about it, and roll dice to see if you are suc-
cessful. Some actions will give your opponent
the opportunity to perform a reactive action.
Read more about this under Ranged Combat
(see page 60) and Close Combat (page 57).

NON-PLAYER
CHARACTERS
In typical conflicts, the GM draws one initiative
card per NPC. If there are many NPCs and the
number of combatants is above ten, the GM splits
the NPCs into groups. All the NPCs with identical
stats form a single group, and the GM draws one
initiative card per group instead of one per indi-
vidual. All the NPCs in a group act at the same
point in the Round order. In what order they act
individually within the group is up to the GM.

If you help another player character or NPC
perform an action, it costs you one action of
the same kind (slow or fast). You have to state
that you are helping someone before any dice
are rolled. Helping others breaks the initiative
order in the Round. You can read more about
helping on page 37.
M O V E M E N T
RUNNING: To move during combat, you can
spend a fast action to run from one zone to a
neighboring zone or between SHORT and ENGAGED
range from an enemy or PC in the same zone you
are already in. No roll is required to run, unless it’s
into a Cluttered zone (see page 49).
CRAWLING :  If you are prone, you can’t run.
Instead, you must crawl. Crawling works just
like running, but it’s a slow action. That means
you can’t crawl twice in the same round. In a
Cramped zone, crawling is the only movement
possible.
C LOSE  CO MB AT:  If you have an active enemy
at ENGAGED range, you can’t just walk away from
them. Instead, you must retreat (see page 59).
D O O R S &  H ATC H E S:  You can open an un-
locked door or hatch with a fast action. A locked
door or hatch can be broken down. A typical
metal door or hatch can take 10 points of damage
before it gives in. More sturdy doors require more
force, and also have an Armor Rating (see page
64). In some cases, you can open an electronically
locked door or hatch with a COMTECH roll.

MARK YOUR ACTIONS
As reactive actions such as blocking and
overwatch fire break the initiative order,
it can be hard to keep track of how many
actions a combatant has performed in the
Round. A tip is to keep track of this by turn-
ing the initiative card 90 degrees for every
performed action. Turn it to the left for a fast
action and to the right for a slow action, and
all the way around 180 degrees once both
actions in the turn are used up.

The key to winning a conflict is often attack-
ing when your enemy least expects it. You can
achieve this in several different ways.
SNEAK ATTAC K:  When you stalk someone
and your attack catches them unawares, it’s called
a sneak attack. First, roll your MOBILITY versus
your target’s OBSERVATION. You get a modification
depending on how close you want to go. See the
table below. If you want to attack in close combat,
you usually have to move to within ENGAGED range
of your enemy. If you fail, your opponent spots
you at your starting distance—draw initiative.
If you succeed, you get a free action (slow or
fast, but not both) before you draw the initiative.
Your target cannot block a sneak attack. Sneak
attacks are always done individually, by one at-
tacker against one target.
A MB U S H :  A special kind of sneak attack is an
ambush. You lie in wait for your enemy and attack
when they come close. When you ambush some-
one, you roll MOBILITY as described above, but
with a modification of +2, since it is the target and
not the attacker that is moving.
Ambushes can be carried out by a group and
against a group of targets. This follows the usual
rules for stealth—the character with the lowest
MOBILITY skill level rolls for the attackers, while the
target with highest OBSERVATION skill level rolls for
the targets.  ■

When you attack someone with your bare fists or
a melee weapon, you use the CLOSE COMBAT skill.
Close combat usually happens at ENGAGED range
from your target. You can fight unarmed or use a
weapon. Drawing a melee weapon from its sheath
or a belt is a fast action.
To attack an opponent in close combat, you
need to be standing on your feet. If you are prone,
you must first spend a fast action to get up before
you can attack. While you are prone, standing
enemies get a +2 modification on all close combat
attacks against you.

If you are attacked in close combat, you can
choose to block the attack, to avoid being hit.
Blocking is a fast action, and you roll for CLOSE
COMBAT. You must declare that you are going to
block before the attacker rolls for their strike. For
each
 you roll, choose an effect below:

T DECREASE DAMAGE: You remove one of the
enemy’s
. If they are left with no
, the at-
tack misses. This effect can be chosen multiple
times.

T COUNTERATTACK: You perform a counterattack,
dealing damage to the attacker equal to the
Damage rating of your weapon. You cannot
spend additional
 to increase the damage of
your counterattack.

T DISARM: You disarm your enemy.
R E AC T I V E  AC T I O N :  Blocking is a reaction
that breaks the normal initiative order in the
Round. However, it does count against your two
available actions in the Round (one slow and one
fast). Each time you block, you lose one action lat-
er in the Round, and if you have already used both
your actions, you can’t block. When it’s your time
to act, it might therefore be wise to save your fast
action if you fear you might be attacked later in the
Round.
B LO C K I N G  U N A R ME D :  If you are unarmed,
you can only block unarmed attacks from other
humans. To block an armed close combat attack,
or an attack by a Xenomorph creature, you need
to wield some kind of sturdy weapon or tool.
R E S O L U T I O N
If your CLOSE COMBAT roll is successful, your
attack hits and you inflict damage equal to the
weapon’s Damage rating on your opponent (see
page 82). Damage may be mitigated by armor.
Read more about damage, armor, and critical
hits on page 64.
STUNTS: For every extra
 you roll, choose
one of these stunts:

T You inflict one additional point of damage. You
can choose this stunt multiple times, if you roll
several
.

T You out-maneuver your enemy and get to ex-
change your initiative score (see page 53) with
them, taking effect next Round. You can’t go
back to your earlier initiative.

T You knock or pull a weapon or other object
from your opponent. You choose which. During
combat, picking up a dropped object counts as
a fast action.

T Your opponent falls prone. This stunt can only
be used on humanoid opponents.

T You pin your enemy in a tight clinch. See Grap-
pling, below. This stunt can only be used on
humans and synthetics.

G R A P P L I N G
If you grapple your opponent as a stunt in
close combat (see above), both you and your
opponent fall to the ground. The opponent
drops any weapon they were holding, and
cannot move. The only action they can per-
form is an attempt to break free—which is a
slow action that succeeds if the opponent
wins an opposed CLOSE COMBAT roll against
you. While you are grappling, the only action
you can perform (apart from releasing your
opponent) is a grapple attack. This works as
a normal unarmed attack, but is a fast action
and cannot be blocked.
X ENOM ORP H S : Alien creatures can grab
you or attach themselves to you in nasty ways.
This follows special rules and is described in
the section on Xenomorphs (see page 78).
S H O V I N G
As a fast action, you can try to shove an op-
ponent at ENGAGED range away from you. This
is done with a CLOSE COMBAT roll. The GM can
modify your roll for certain opponents. If you
succeed, your opponent is shoved away to
SHORT range from you. Shoving a target away
can be useful if you want to engage it in ranged
combat rather than fight it hand-to-hand.
Shoves can be blocked (above).  ■
R E T R E A T
If you have an active enemy at ENGAGED range,
you must make a MOBILITY roll to move away
to SHORT range from them. If you fail, you still
move but your enemy gets a free close com-
bat attack against you. The free attack doesn’t
count toward their actions in the Round and
you can’t block it.

NPCS AND BLOCKING
Typically, NPCs don’t block attacks. The
GM can override this rule, however, when
dramatically appropriate.

When you shoot at someone from a distance, roll
for RANGED COMBAT. You need to be able to see
your target. You also need a ranged weapon, even
if it’s simply something to throw. The weapons
tables in Chapter 5 describe a variety of firearms
and other ranged weapons. To draw a gun from
a belt or holster, or a rifle from its sling, is a fast
action. Firing a weapon is a slow action.
AIMING: If you take your time to aim carefully before
squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack
roll. Aiming is a fast action. If you do anything else
except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or
if you are hurt, you lose the effect of the aim and you
need to spend another fast action to aim again.
R A N G E :  The weapons tables in Chapter 5 indi-
cate the range of each weapon, i.e. the maximum
range category at which the weapon can be used.
The farther away your target is, the harder it is
to hit. At MEDIUM range you get a −1 modification,
and at LONG range you get −2. At ENGAGED range
you get −3, because it’s hard to draw a bead on an
opponent that close. You don’t get this penalty if
you fire at a defenseless or unwitting enemy—in-
stead, you get a +3 modification.
TA R G E T  S I Z E :  Firing at a large target, such as a
vehicle, gives a +2 modification to the attack. Firing
at a small object, such as a small hatch, a hand-held
item, or a Chestburster, gives a –2 modification.

When bullets start flying, you’ll do well to
seek cover behind something sturdy. Unlike
blocking in close combat, you need to find
cover before someone shoots at you. Taking
cover behind something in the same zone as
you is a fast action. Cover has an Armor Rat-
ing and works just like armor (see the table to
the right). When you're hit by a ranged attack,
roll a number of Base Dice equal to the Armor
Rating. Each
 you roll lowers the damage
by one point. Cover and armor can be com-
bined, simply add the Armor Ratings.
A M M O
Most firearms in the world of ALIEN have large
enough magazines that you don’t need to wor-
ry about counting individual bullets. However,
when the tension rises, you risk wasting ammo
and emptying your clip at the worst possible
time. This is simulated in the following way:
Whenever you fire a weapon and roll one
or more
 on your Stress Dice (see page 69),
you have emptied your magazine after the at-
tack and need to reload (in addition to making
a Panic Roll). Reloading is a slow action. You
need to keep track of how many full reloads of
ammunition you carry for your weapon.
F U L L  A U T O  F I R E
Weapons listed as fully automatic can fire long
bursts of full auto fire. This counts as a normal
ranged attack, but with a few differences:

T You get a +2 modification to your roll.

T Your STRESS LEVEL immediately increases by
one. Add the Stress Die to your roll for the
full auto burst.

T You can distribute any additional
 you
roll beyond the first to secondary targets
within SHORT range of the primary target.
The first
 assigned to a secondary target
inflicts damage equal to the Damage rating
of the weapon, and further
 assigned to
a secondary target can be used for stunts.

NPCS AND COVER
Typically, NPCs don’t take cover in combat.
The GM can override this rule however, when
dramatically appropriate.

ANDROIDS AND AMMO
Note that androids don’t have STRESS LEVELS and
thus don’t risk running out of ammo. This in
intentional, to simulate the controlled nature of
synthetics. As for NPCs, they run out of ammo
if and when the GM finds it dramatically appro-
priate.

As a fast action, you can assume an overwatch
position in a specified direction, as long as
you have a ranged weapon and no enemies
within ENGAGED range. This means that you
aim in the specified direction and are ready
to shoot. Between the time you assume the
overwatch position and your time to act in the
next Round, you can fire your weapon against
a target in the chosen direction.
You can fire whenever you want in the turn
order, and your shot is resolved before all other
actions—even if they are already declared.
For example, if an enemy in the direction you
are aiming declares that they want to fire a
weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not
allowed to change their attack after your over-
watch attack.
Firing when in overwatch position counts as
a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you
must save your slow action in the Round for
any overwatch attack you want to make.
If both you and an enemy assume over-
watch positions against each other, and both
choose to fire against each other, then an
opposed RANGED COMBAT roll determines which
attack goes first. This roll does not count as an
action for either of you.
LOSI N G  OV E RWATC H :  You keep your
overwatch position as long as you do nothing
but shoot in the chosen direction. If you per-
form any other action, the overwatch position
is lost. It is also immediately lost if either of
the following occurs:

T You are attacked in close combat.

You run the risk of being injured in combat.
Everything from exhaustion to bleeding cuts
and broken bones is summarized as damage.
How much damage you can take is deter-
mined by your Health score.
STARTING H E A LT H :  When not injured,
your total Health score is equal to your
STRENGTH. Talents can modify your maximum
Health total.
A R M O R
To protect yourself from harm, you can wear
armor (see Chapter 5). The effectiveness of
a piece of armor is represented by its Armor
Rating. You can only wear one suit of armor
at a time. When you take damage from an at-
tack, roll a number of Base Dice equal to your
Armor Rating. Each
 you roll lowers the
damage inflicted by one point. The armor roll
does not count as an action for you.
R E C O V E R Y
When you are no longer Broken, you recover
one point of lost Health per Turn (5–10 min-
utes) of rest. Critical injuries can still affect
you after all your Health is restored, however.
B R O K E N
If you drop to zero Health, you are Broken—in
effect, taken out of the action. Immediately
roll for a critical injury. If you’re not dead, you
can crawl and mumble through the pain—you
can’t perform any other actions and you can’t
roll for any skills. You can’t go below zero
Health, but each further attack that causes
damage will give you another critical injury.
G E T T I N G  B A C K  U P
Being Broken is not fatal in itself—only crit-
ical injuries can actually kill you. There are
two ways to get back up after being Broken,
assuming you’re not dead.
F I R ST  A I D :  Someone can help you back
onto your feet by administering first aid to
you using the MEDICAL AID skill. This is a slow
action. Certain medical equipment can give
bonuses to the roll (see Chapter 5). If the roll
is successful, you get back up immediately,
regaining Health equal to the number of
 in
the skill roll. Administering first aid to some-
one who isn’t Broken has no effect.
O N  YO U R  OW N :  If you’re Broken and no
one is around to help you, you automatically
recover one point of Health after one Turn
(5–10 minutes) has passed, and can then get
back up on your own.

A Broken character is defenseless. If it’s a
human being and you want to kill your target
outright, you must fail an EMPATHY roll (roll
for the attribute only, without Stress Dice).
Whether or not you succeed at killing your
target, you increase your STRESS LEVEL by one—
killing in cold blood is not that easy. If you
have the Merci​less talent, you can kill defense-
less enemies without this negative effect.
C R I T I C A L  I N J U R I E S
As long as you still have Health left, damage
points represent fatigue, bruises or smaller
cuts—painful, to be sure, but possible to over-
come. Critical injuries represent a much more
dangerous form of injury. These can maim or kill
you. When knocked down to zero Health, roll a
D66 on the critical injury table on page 66.
D E A T H
If you suffer a critical injury listed as fatal, you
must make a Death Roll when the listed time
runs out. A Death Roll is a roll for STAMINA,
but you cannot push the roll and you are not
allowed to roll any Stress Dice. If the Death Roll
fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on but
you must make another Death Roll when the
listed amount of time has passed again.
SAV I N G  YO U R  LI F E :  To save your life
when you have suffered a fatal critical injury,
someone must give you first aid before you
fail a Death Roll. First aid is a slow action and
requires a MEDICAL AID roll. Note that some
critical injuries are so severe that a negative
modification is applied to the MEDICAL AID roll.
If you recover a Health point by yourself
(after one Turn, see above) before you fail a
Death Roll, you can try to give yourself first
aid, but you get a –2 modification to the roll.
Each character who attempts to treat you can
try only once—to get a second chance, better
medical equipment is needed.
B R O K E N :  If you are both Broken and have
sustained a fatal critical injury (or several), two
separate MEDICAL AID rolls are needed: one to
get you back on your feet, and another to save
your life. These two rolls can be made in which-
ever order you prefer.
I N STA N T  K I LL:  Note that there are four
critical injuries (results #63–66) that kill you
outright. If you roll any of these, your character
shuffles off their mortal coil. No Death Roll is
allowed.

BROKEN NPCS
NPCs can be Broken in the same ways as
PCs. An NPC can administer first aid to a PC
and vice versa. However, dice are usually
not rolled when an NPC aids another NPC—
instead, the GM decides what happens. The
GM can also decide that a minor NPC who is
Broken simply dies.

PERMANENT mental TRAUMA
D6
EFFECT
1
PHOBIA: You are terrified by something related to what caused you to panic. The GM decides what it is.
Your STRESS LEVEL increases by one when within SHORT range of the object of your phobia. If you stay
close to it for more than a single round, make a Panic Roll.
2
ALCOHOLISM: You must drink alcohol every Shift, or your STRESS LEVEL increases by one. You cannot
relieve stress (see page 70) without drinking alcohol.
3
NIGHTMARES: Make an EMPATHY roll when you sleep. If the roll succeeds, you have a horrible nightmare
and your STRESS LEVEL increases by one. You cannot relieve stress for a full day after such a nightmare.
4
DEPRESSION: You are prone to episodes of depression and moodiness. Every day, make an EMPATHY
roll—if you fail, you’re having a bad day. Your STRESS LEVEL increases by one and you can’t relieve
stress until the next day.
5
DRUG USE: You must use some form of recreational drug (see page 101) every Shift, or your STRESS LEV-
EL increases by one. You cannot relieve stress (see page 70) without consuming your drug of choice.
6
AMNESIA: Your memory is a blank slate. You can no longer recall who you or the other characters are.
The effect should be roleplayed.

HANDLING DEATH
The death of a PC can be traumatic, but try
not to see it as a failure. Instead, consider it
a dramatic peak in your story—a moment to
remember, a fallen comrade to mourn—and
then get back into the action as soon as
possible. In Cinematic scenarios like the one
included in this Starter Kit, the GM will gen-
erally have another character or NPC ready
for you to play.
H E A L I N G
Each critical injury has a specific effect that
you suffer during the healing time indicated,
which is measured in days.
C A R E :  If someone tends to you daily during
the process of healing a critical injury (or
several) and makes a MEDICAL AID roll, the re-
maining healing time is reduced by half. Any
earlier roll to save your life does not count
towards this. A new roll is required to reduce
the healing time.
H E A LT H  P O I N TS :  Note that you can
recover all your lost Health points, but still
suffer the effects of a critical injury.  ■

The mounting tension in your character is mea-
sured by their STRESS LEVEL. It usually starts at
zero, and increases during the course of the
game. Your STRESS LEVEL increases by one when-
ever one of the following happens:

T You push a skill roll.

T You fire a burst of full auto fire (see page 62).

T You suffer one or more points of damage.

T You go without sleep, food, or water.

T You perform a coup de grâce (see page 65).

T A Scientist in your team fails to use the Analy-
sis talent (see Chariot of the Gods).

T A member of your own crew attacks you.

T A person nearby is revealed to be an android.

T You encounter certain creatures or locations,
as determined by the scenario or the GM.
G A I N I N G  ST R E SS  D I C E :  Whenever you
make a skill roll (see page 32), you must add a
number of Stress Dice equal to your current STRESS
LEVEL to your roll—your stress makes you more
focused, increasing your chance to succeed. There’s
a flip side to this though—if you roll one or more

on your Stress Dice, you must make a Panic Roll.

As long as you keep your stress in check, you
can use it to your advantage. But if the ten-
sion grows too strong it can explode, sending
you into a wild panic. You need to make a
Panic Roll when any of the following happens:

T You roll one or more
 on your Stress
Dice in a skill roll. If this happens, you can't
push the skill roll—instead, roll for panic.

T You witness a friendly character suffering
from a certain panic effect (see the table).

T You are pinned down by a ranged attack.

T You suffer a critical injury.

T You’re attacked by a strange alien creature
that you’ve never seen before.

T A truly horrifying event occurs, as deter-
mined by a scenario or the GM.
RESOLUTION : Roll a D6, add your current
STRESS LEVEL, and check the table to the right.
PANIC ACTI O N S :  If you roll a 10 or higher
on your Panic Roll, you will be forced to per-
form a specific action. If the Panic Roll was
the result of a skill check for an action, the ac-
tion is cancelled and immediately replaced by
the forced panic action, even if you rolled
.
MORE PANIC:  If you are suffering from a
panic effect (7+ on the Panic Roll) and are
forced to make another Panic Roll, the new
panic effect replaces the previous one. If the
new roll is lower than the previous effect,
however, it is automatically adjusted to one
step more severe than the previous effect.
OVERKILL: The Overkill talent lets you
replace the effect of a Panic Roll result of 11 or
higher by the Overkill effect, if you have any
enemies in sight. When triggering Overkill, you
must immediately attack your enemies and you
won’t stop until you or all enemies in sight are
Broken. Also, all other PCs in SHORT range of
you must make an immediate Panic Roll.
S T O P P I N G  P A N I C
Some effects on the Panic Roll table are imme-
diate or last one Round. Others remain in effect
until one of the following happens:

T Another character comes to your aid and
makes a COMMAND roll (see page 45). This
counts as a slow action in combat.

T You are Broken.

T One Turn passes.
R E L I E V I N G  S T R E S S
For every full Turn (5–10 minutes) spent resting
in a safe area that is secured from enemies (as
far as you know), your STRESS LEVEL is reduced
by one point. You cannot make any skill rolls
when resting, and if your rest is interrupted, it
doesn’t count. A Panic Roll can also decrease
stress, as can certain drugs.
Once per Act in Cinematic play, and once
per game session in Campaign play, you can
interact with your signature item in some way
to reduce your STRESS LEVEL one step. This
typically requires a slow action.
Some conditions, such as Starving or Freez-
ing (see page 72), can block your ability to
relieve stress.
P E R M A N E N T
M E N T A L  T R A U M A
If you have rolled a result of 13 or higher on
a Panic Roll during a game session, you must
make an EMPATHY roll after the session. Roll for
the attribute only, not using any skill. If the roll
succeeds, you develop a permanent mental
trauma of some kind. Roll a D6 and consult
the table on page 67.  ■

friendly PCs in SHORT range increases by one. After one Round, you can act normally.
12

STRESS LEVEL is decreased by one, but every friendly character who hears your scream
must make an immediate Panic Roll.
13
FLEE. You just can’t take it anymore. You must flee to a safe place and refuse to leave it.
You won’t attack anyone and won’t attempt anything dangerous. You are not allowed
to make a retreat roll (see page 59) if you have an enemy at ENGAGED range when you
flee. Your STRESS LEVEL is decreased by one, but every friendly character who sees you
run must make an immediate Panic Roll.
14
BERSERK. You must immediately attack the nearest person or creature, friendly or not.
You won’t stop until you or the target is Broken. Every friendly character who witnesses
your rampage must make an immediate Panic Roll.
15+
CATATONIC. You collapse to the floor and can’t talk or move, staring blankly into oblivion.

NPCs AND PANIC
STRESS LEVELs are only tracked for PCs, never
for NPCs, and NPCs never make Panic Rolls—
instead, NPCs panic when the GM deems it
appropriate. Panicking NPCs can increase the
STRESS LEVEL of PCs nearby. This is up to the
GM's judgement.

The world of ALIEN is unforgiving, and there
are many ways for your character to suffer
and die. In the game, there are four so-called
conditions: Starving, Dehydrated, Exhausted,
and Freezing. These can cause damage and
block recovery. Mark conditions in the relevant
check boxes on your character sheet.
D E H Y D R A T E D
After a day without sufficient water, you
become Dehydrated. Being Dehydrated has
several effects:

T You cannot recover Health or relieve Stress.

T Every Shift, you suffer one point of dam-
age and your STRESS LEVEL increases one
step. If you are Broken while Dehydrated,
you must make a Death Roll after every
Shift without liquid. MEDICAL AID has no
effect against these Death Rolls, you need
fluids to save yourself.

T As soon as you drink, the above effects
wear off within one Shift.
E X H A U S T E D
You need to sleep for at least one Shift each
day. After one day without sufficient sleep,
you become Exhausted. Being Exhausted has
several effects:

T You cannot relieve Stress.

T You must make a STAMINA roll each day (the
GM decides when), with a negative modi-
fication equal to the number of days spent
without decent sleep. If the roll fails, you
collapse and sleep for one Shift.

T As soon as you have slept for at least one
Shift, you are no longer Exhausted.
S T A R V I N G
After a day without sufficient food, you
become Starving. Being Starving has several
effects:

T You cannot recover Health or relieve Stress.

T Every day, you need to make a STAMINA roll.
If you fail, you suffer one point of damage
and your STRESS LEVEL increases one step.
If you are Broken while Starving, you need
to make a Death Roll (see page 65) every
day. MEDICAL AID has no effect against these
Death Rolls, you can only be saved by in-
gesting some form of sustenance.

T As soon as you have eaten, the above ef-
fects wear off within one Shift.

Space is a cold and unforgiving place. Without
the protection of a space suit or the hull of a ship,
you won’t last long in the black void. If your ship
suffers explosive decompression (below) or if you
are thrown out of an airlock, your life is in extreme
danger. The absence of pressure creates gas bubbles
in your blood, causing your whole body to swell up.
This results in crippling pain, all while the raw UV
radiation from the nearest star sears your skin. You
can’t hold your breath—if you do, your lungs collapse.
After that, you are just moments away from death.
You must make a STAMINA roll every Round
without protection in a vacuum. The test doesn’t
require an action, but you must roll it before doing
anything else in the round. The roll is unmodified
for the first Round, but you get a –1 modification
for the second Round. In the third Round you get
–2, and so on. A failed roll means you drop directly
to zero Health and must make a Death Roll every
Round until you die or you enter a pressurized
area. You don't suffer a critical injury.
Before going unconscious, you should put all your
efforts towards getting a space suit on, if one can be
found nearby. Climbing into a space suit quickly (a
single slow action) requires a successful MOBILITY roll.
E XP LOSI V E  D E CO MP R E SS I O N :  Firing guns
inside a spacecraft is very dangerous. If a shot misses
its target in a room next to an outer bulkhead, the
weapon will inflict its base Damage rating on the
bulkhead instead. Roll for the Armor Rating of the
bulkhead (a typical civilian ship has Armor Rating 6).
If the armor roll fails to stop the shot, it will
penetrate the bulkhead, which means bad news
for everyone. The air in the room will vent out into
space in a Turn, and the intense draft will require
everyone to make a STAMINA roll to perform any ac-
tion (the STAMINA roll itself counts as a fast action).
Most ships will automatically seal off a
breached compartment. Once the air is gone, any-
one still in the vented compartment will suffer the
effects of vacuum.

In an environment without enough clothes or
shelter, you become Freezing. Being Freezing
has several effects:

T You cannot recover Health or relieve Stress.

T You need to make STAMINA rolls at regular
intervals. The colder it is, the more fre-
quently you need to roll. If above freez-
ing, once per day is enough. In sub-zero
temperatures, roll once per Shift, and in
the deep cold of space, you need to roll
every Turn. If you fail, you suffer one point
of damage and your STRESS LEVEL increases
one step. If you are Broken while Freezing,
you must make a Death Roll the next time
you would need to roll for the cold.

T As soon as you get warm, you stop rolling
for STAMINA and can recover Health and
relieve Stress normally.

The force of an explosion is measured in Blast
Power. For each person within SHORT range of
the blast when the detonation occurs, roll a
number of Base Dice equal to the Blast Power.
For every
 rolled, the victim suffers one
point of damage. The roll cannot be pushed.
Victims at ENGAGED range from the detonation
suffer one extra point of damage.
E F F E C T  R A D I U S:  Powerful charges, with
a Blast Power of 7 or more, can harm people
even at MEDIUM range. The Blast Power is then
reduced by 6. If there are many people within
MEDIUM range of the blast, the GM can simplify
the process by rolling once and applying the
result to all victims.
F I R E
A fire is measured in Intensity. A typical fire
has Intensity 8. When exposed to fire, roll a
number of Base Dice equal to the Intensity.
For every
 rolled, you suffer one point of
damage. Armor can protect you.
If you take damage, you catch fire and
continue to burn and suffer another attack at
the start of each new Round. The Intensity in-
creases by one each Round. As soon as a fire
attack inflicts no damage, the fire goes out by
itself. You, or a friend at ENGAGED range, can
put out the fire with a successful MOBILITY roll
(slow action).
If you are Broken by fire damage, or suffer
fire damage when already Broken, you must
make a Death Roll every Round until you die
or you are saved by a MEDICAL AID roll.

When exposed to a dangerous contagion or infec-
tion, you need to roll an opposed roll for STAMINA
against the Virulence rating of the disease. This
is called a Sickness Roll. A typical disease has a
Virulence of 3, but there are diseases with much
higher ratings. If you fail the roll, you fall sick,
which has several effects:

T One Shift after infection the disease breaks
out, at which time you suffer one point of
damage.

T You can’t recover your Health while sick.

T Make another Sickness Roll at the start of each
Shift. Each failed roll means you suffer another
point of damage.

T If you are Broken while sick, you must make
another Sickness Roll after every Shift—failure
means death.

T As soon as you succeed at a Sickness Roll, you
are no longer sick. Stop rolling Sickness Rolls
and recover your Health normally.

The world of ALIEN contains many places
where you will be exposed to hard radiation—
on a spacewalk near a dying star, for example,
or when you try to repair your ship’s leaking
reactor core.
RADIATION L E V E L :  When you are ex-
posed to radiation, you gain Radiation Points,
or Rads, that accumulate in your body. Check
off the Rad boxes on your character sheet.
The area’s Radiation Level determines how
often you get Rads.

T WEAK RADIATION: 1 Rad per Shift

T STRONG RADIATION: 1 Rad per Turn

T EXTREME RADIATION: 1 Rad per Round
EFFECTS: Every time you gain a Radiation
Point, you must roll a number of dice equal
to your total current number of accumulated
Rads. For every
 in the roll, you take one
point of damage.
If you are Broken by radiation damage,
you must make a Death Roll each time you
get another Rad, until you are removed from
the radiation hotspot. As long as you remain
inside a hotspot, you cannot recover Health in
any way.
RECOVERY:  After you leave the irradiated
area, you heal one Rad per Shift.
P ERM ANENT  RA D IAT IO N : There is a
risk that the radiation will permanently stay in
your body. Every time you are about to heal a
Rad, roll a Stress Die. If it shows
, the Rad
is not healed but instead becomes permanent.
Mark this by filling in the Rad box fully on
your character sheet. Permanent radiation can
never be healed.
D R O W N I N G
All player characters are assumed to know
how to swim. For the purposes of movement,
swimming counts as crawling.
If, by choice or not, you are underwater,
you need to make a STAMINA roll every Round.
This roll is not an action and is made during
your turn before you perform your actions. If
you fail, you suffer one point of damage. If you
are Broken when drowning, you must make a
Death Roll each Turn, until you die or someone
saves you with a MEDICAL AID roll.
S U F F O C A T I O N
If your supply of air runs out (see page
29), you won’t have long to live. You’ll start
breathing in your own exhaled air, building up
dangerous levels of carbon dioxide that will
eventually kill you.
After your air supply runs out, you must
make a STAMINA roll every Turn or after every
strenuous activity (like a roll for CLOSE COMBAT
or MOBILITY). The first roll is unmodified, the
second roll gets a –1 modification, the third
gets –2, and so on. A failed roll means you
drop directly to zero Health and must make a
Death Roll every Round until you die or you
enter a pressurized area.

S Y N T H E T I C S
Synthetic individuals are increasingly common
in the Core Systems, and appear on the Fron-
tier as well. Some are open about their artificial
nature, others pose as humans. In combat,
androids act like humans, and they roll skill rolls
normally. But there are several differences:
ATTRIBUTE S :  Synthetics generally have
higher attribute scores than humans.
SKILLS & ST RE SS : Androids can’t push
skill rolls. They don’t suffer stress, don’t have a
STRESS LEVEL, and they never make Panic Rolls.
DAM AGE: If a synthetic is Broken, roll for a
critical injury on the table to the right. Until
the android suffers a System Shutdown, it can
continue to operate, only suffering the effects
of the critical injury. This makes androids very
hard to stop. Each further attack inflicting
damage on a Broken android will inflict anoth-
er critical injury. If you roll the same critical
injury again, shift it down one step on the
table (from a 4 to a 5, for example).
REPAIRS: Androids don’t heal. Instead, a
Shift of work and a COMTECH roll is required
to repair all lost Health points and all critical
injuries, as long as the android hasn't suffered a
System Shutdown. They can repair themselves.
DEATH: Androids don't make Death Rolls and
cannot “die.” If they suffer a System Shutdown
they can be reactivated to communicate with.
This requires a power source, a Turn of work,
and a COMTECH roll. An android “revived” in this
way can be repaired (above) to working order,
but it will suffer a permanent mental trauma.
RESOURCE S :  Synthetics don’t need air,
food, water, or sleep. They are immune to vac-
uum, cold, and disease. Androids are typically
unaffected by alien pathogens.

The android is torn to shreds or

ELECTRIC SHEEP
It is illegal to program an android for violence
against humans. While modern synthetics are
governed by behavioral inhibitors that prevent
them from injuring others, earlier models are
not so equipped and are therefore dangerous.
Expensive bypass packages are available on the
black market for those who want to circumvent
these laws. An android that goes too long with-
out scheduled maintenance can also begin to
experience mental degradation and the onset of
psychosis, which will render the inhibitors moot.

X E N O M O R P H S
You’ve heard the stories about the monsters
out there. You better hope that you won’t need
to face one yourself. Fighting Xenomorph
beings is something different entirely and far
more deadly than facing humans or even an-
droids. Very few have lived to tell the tale.
In combat, Xenomorphs follow special
rules. More information for the GM can be
found in the Chariot of the Gods scenario.
MULTIPLE AC T IO N S :  Some Xenomorphs
get to act twice or even three times in a Round.
For such creatures, the GM draws a number of
initiative cards equal to their Speed rating. At
the time of each initiative, the Xenomorph gets
to perform one fast and one slow action.
S IGNATURE AT TAC KS :  Most Xenomorphs
attack only in close combat, at ENGAGED range.
Each time a Xenomorph attacks, the GM rolls a
D6, consults a table for the creature’s signature
attacks, and resolves the effects. Some signa-
ture attacks are extremely deadly.
HEALTH: When a Xenomorph is reduced to
zero Health, it isn’t Broken in the way a human
is. Instead, the GM rolls a D6 on a special criti-
cal injury table.
ARM OR RAT IN G :  Most Xenomorphs have a
thick hide, resistant to attacks, giving them a
natural Armor Rating.
SPECIAL AB IL IT IE S :  Some Xenomorph
have special actions beyond the signature at-
tacks. This is specified under each Xenomorph
description.

You always want a weapon close at hand—you
never know where danger lurks. Don’t expect
to have your choice of firearms, however. When
something hisses at you in the dark, you can’t be
too choosy, understand? You use whatever you
can get your hands on to buy you some time. The
tables and images on the following pages show
various kinds of common weapons.
W E A P O N  F E A T U R E S
Different weapons neutralize different threats.
This list is a heads-up on the features used in the
weapon tables.
B ONUS indicates any modification you get to
your CLOSE COMBAT or RANGED COMBAT roll when
using the weapon.
DAMAGE is the base Damage rating, i.e. how
many points of damage your target suffers if
your attack is successful. If you roll extra
, you
can deal additional damage. The word “Blast”
followed by a number means that the weapon
inflicts no direct damage, but instead triggers an
explosion with the Blast Power indicated.
RANGE is the maximum range category at
which the weapon can be effectively used.
W E I G H T  indicates how many typical items the
weapon counts as in the inventory list (see page
29). If no weight is indicated, the weapon is too
heavy to be carried.
COST is the weapon’s typical price in United
American (UA) dollars. The actual price varies
depending on the supply and demand at the
location.
SPECIAL is any special effects that this weap-
on has. “Armor Piercing” means that any Armor
Rating counts as half against this weapon, round-
ing fractions up. “Armor Doubled” means that any
Armor Rating is doubled against the weapon.
By now, you know that life on the Frontier sucks.
The only way you are going to make it out here is
by gearing up and keeping your wits. This chapter
can’t help you hold your shit together, but it gives
you what you need to breathe in deep space and
stomp some bugs. And since we all know that
stomping is more important than breathing, let’s
start there, shall we? ■

M 4 A3  SERV IC E  P ISTO L : This inexpensive
9mm pistol is the standard sidearm of the USC-
MC. You should always have a backup for your
backup, and this pistol might as well be it.
. 357 M AGN U M  RE VO LV E R: A classic
high caliber revolver, equally popular amongst
both Frontier Marshals and lowlifes.
REX IM RX F- M 5  E VA  P ISTO L :  A
miniaturized and weaponized version of a
Weyland-Yutani laser welder in use from the
2100-2120s. This tool was originally impro-
vised as a weapon by the J’Har rebels during
the 2106 uprising on Torin Prime. Always one
to find profit in anything, Weyland-Yutani
studied the modifications after the war and
made them the standard self-defense arma-
ment on their commercial fleet.
WATATSUM I DV-303 B O LT  G U N : The
DV-303 is a construction tool that uses
expanding bolts to make emergency hull
repairs. The DV-303 can be turned into an
improvised weapon—firing bolts like a single
round shotgun—a trick first used by Frontier
rebels in the early 2100s. This weapon must
be reloaded (slow action) after each shot.

R I F L E S
ARM AT M 41A  P U L S E  RIFL E :  The standard
issue weapon of the USCMC, the M41A Pulse Rifle
is a 10mm automatic assault rifle with underslung
30mm pump-action grenade launcher combined
in a sturdy housing with retractable stock and op-
tional scope. The M41A fires explosive-tip caseless
standard light armor-penetrating US M309 rounds
accelerated via electronic pulse. Remaining ammo
is tracked via an LED counter and the rifle has two
firing modes—burst and full automatic. For more
about the grenade launcher, see the U1 below.
An otherwise reliable weapon, the M41A can jam
when fully-loaded, so partially loaded magazines
are recommended. (In their downtime on mission
Marines will take the time to remove a few rounds
from each of the magazines they carry.) Even with
this flaw, the M41A is what you want slung over
your shoulder—but if you are a civilian, good luck
getting a permit to own one.
AK- 4 047 P U L S E  ASSAU LT  RIFL E:  The
UPP equivalent to the M41A Pulse Rifle, the AK-
4047 is a cheap and reliable substitute.  While not
as accurate, the AK-4047  is much sturdier than
the USCMC weapon. An AK-4047 still works after
being thrown off a cliff and left underwater for a
month.
ARM AT M 42 A  S CO P E  RIFL E : Equipped
with a folding bipod, muzzle flash suppressor,
and a fully adjustable stock, the M42A is USCMC’s
semi-automatic electronic pulse sniper rifle of
choice. If you manage to see what’s lurking in the
shadows before it sees you, you go ahead and
take the shot.
A R MAT  MO D E L 37A 2  1 2  G AU G E  P UMP
AC T I O N :  A classic pump-action combat shot-
gun, the M37A2 is an optional weapon in use by
the USCMC. Reliable and direct, the '37 is the gun
you want to keep handy for close encounters.
A R MAT  XM9 9 A  P H AS E D  P LAS MA  PUL SE
R I F LE :  Another prototype being tested by the
USCMC, the extremely potent XM99A can kill a
man and most creatures with a single shot. The
weapon has a plasma charge build-up delay upon
firing—so take care in lining up your target and
make sure you hold steady. If you pull the trigger
and check to see why it hasn’t gone off yet, you
just may accidentally redefine the term “friendly
fire.” This weapon must be aimed carefully (fast ac-
tion) before it’s fired. The weapon consumes a lot
of electricity, and you need to make a Power Sup-
ply roll after every shot (see page 29). Its battery
has a Power Supply level of 5 when fully charged.
SPAC E SU B  ASS O - 4 0 0  H A R P O O N
G R A P P LI N G  G U N : Designed for aiding in
emergency manual docking maneuvers, the
ASSO-400 fires a grappling-hook-tipped harpoon
that carries a tether. The ASSO-400 is used to
close the distance between free-floating objects
and personnel in space. On a hit with this weapon,
the grappling hook attaches to the target. If the
target is heavier than you, you can use the tether
to rappel quickly toward the target (slow action,
moves you from MEDIUM range to ENGAGED). If you
are heavier, you can instead pull the target toward
you (requires a STRENGTH vs. STRENGTH opposed
roll if the target resists).

dirty BULLETS
Here’s where things start getting particularly
nasty. The target of these radioactive bullets
not only suffers piercing damage, but their
wounds are irradiated in the process. Any
ammunition type can be treated with radio-
nuclides, but it’s going to cost you four times
the cost of normal ammo. Make sure you take
the proper precautionary steps when using
them—dirty bullets not only leave your gun
glowing in the dark, but also your shooting
hand and holster hip riddled with cancer.
U-238 tipped bullets reduce the Armor
Rating of any target by two, after the Armor
Piercing or Armor Doubled effects have been
applied. Anyone hit by a U-238 bullet suffers
1 Rad in addition to normal damage. Carrying
a weapon loaded with U-238 tipped bullets
gives you 1 Rad per Shift.

H E A V Y  W E A P O N S
ARMAT U1 GRENADE LAUNCHER: This 30mm
pump-action is typically found as part of the M41A
Pulse Rifle, but individual units do exist. Standard
payload for the U1 is M40 High Explosive fragmen-
tation grenades, but the launcher accommodates
a variety of other grenade types from smoke and
flash grenades to electronic G2 Electroshock Gre-
nades (below). When facing superior numbers, the
U1 is your friend—don’t enter an alien hive without
one. Well, don’t enter a hive with one, either. Just
stay away from the hive. Okay?
A target hit by a frag grenade suffers explosion
damage (Blast Power 9) plus one extra point of
damage. All other targets in the same zone suffer
explosion damage. A smoke grenade causes no
damage but blocks line of sight inside, into, and out
of the target zone. A flash grenade forces all targets
in the zone to make an immediate STAMINA roll (no
action) or lose their next slow action. If a grenade
misses, it lands in a random adjacent zone.
ARM AT M 41A E 2  H E AVY  P U L S E  RI F LE :  A
USCMC Squad Automatic Weapon modification
of the M41A, this electric pulse support rifle has
a longer barrel in place of the U1 grenade launch-
er. This is the machinegun you want laying down
suppressing fire to cover your ass during an evac.
M 5 6A2 SMA RT  G U N : The heavy firepower of
every USCMC squad, the M56 Smartgun is mounted
on an articulating arm and gimbal attached to an
armored harness worn by the weapon’s operator.
What makes the M56A2 a smart gun is its ability to
choose targets for you. It is equipped with an infra-
red tracking system and data transmitter/receiver
that homes in on potential threats and sends that
information to a Head Mounted Sight. Fire control is
still at your discretion, so if you are running low on
ammo, pick your targets. The M56A2 fires in either
bursts or full automatic. A glancing shot can sever
a limb and a full burst can cut a person in half, so
watch that friendly fire, Private.
THE M 24 0 IN C IN E RATO R U N IT:  This car-
bine-style flamethrower uses naphtha fuel canisters
to fire a thick, steady stream of flame at a target. It
is in common use by the USCMC, who deploy the
weapon at the squad and fireteam level. Civilian
models exist too. The troops in the field have given
the M240 the unceremonious nickname of “Bake-
a-Flake.” It’s a good standby weapon to have in a
pinch, especially when facing off against hostile
organisms. Most animals retreat from fire, yes? Any
target hit by an incinerator unit also catches fire,
Intensity 9 (see page 74).
UA  57 1 - C  AU TO MAT E D  S E N T RY  G UN :
These tripod-mounted robot sentries form an
automated perimeter defense system that tracks
and automatically fires upon any target that moves
within range. The UA 571 series is equipped with
automatic thermal and movement actuated AI
targeting capabilities. The UA 571-C utilizes an M30
Autocannon. Just be mindful of your friend or foe
settings before walking in front of one. Those set
up with ARS—Advanced Recognition Software—
can be programmed to identify friendly targets
with a variable success rate. If set for motion and
heat only, anything hot that moves might as well
be dead. When activated, the Sentry Gun is always
in overwatch position and fires with skill level 8
in RANGED COMBAT (no AGILITY). The Sentry Gun can
also be operated remotely by using a Head Mount-
ed Sight.
G2 ELECTROSHOCK GRENADE: These grenades
are called “electronic ballbreakers” with good
reason. When deployed, they propel themselves
about 3 feet off the ground before releasing a me-
ga-voltage electric pulse. The usually non-lethal
shock is still strong enough to freeze a person’s
central nervous system. These weapons are good
for crowd control. When there is only one seat left
on the last shuttle to leave a space station stuck
in a decaying orbit around a gas giant, pop a few
of these puppies into the mob, cycle that airlock
closed, and strap yourself in for the ride home.
All humans in the target zone must make a hard
STAMINA roll (–2, doesn’t count as an action) or be
stunned for one Round.

ST U N  B ATO N :  Basically a cattle prod, these
electroshock devices are designed to keep pests and
livestock in order on the Frontier. While the charge
isn’t strong enough to kill a human, a touch can
incapacitate the target. If you see something lurking
underfoot, hit it with it. Shouldn’t damage the little
bastard, unless its skin is thinner than ours…
Anyone hit by a stun baton who takes one or
more points of damage must make an immedi-
ate STAMINA roll (doesn’t count as an action) or be
stunned for one Round. After each attack, you need
to make a Power Supply roll. The battery has a Pow-
er Supply level of 5 when fully charged.
M E C H A N I C A L  C U T T I N G  TO R C H :  A utilitar-
ian blowtorch used for both welding and cutting
through metal. In a pinch, a cutting torch can be
used as a weapon. The Rexim EVA pistol started
life as a laser cutting torch. You want to stay alive?
You need to improvise. You need to make a Power
Supply roll after every use. Its battery has a Power
Supply level of 5 when fully charged.

NO WEAPONS
OF ANY KIND
You want to be careful where you
point that thing in space. Firefights
onboard spacecraft, space stations,
and within pressure domes can be
disastrous—a stray bullet can rupture
the hull and vent an entire living sector
into space (see page 73 for rules on
this). People have been blown out into
space through the tiniest of tears in
the hull—a gruesome way to go, for
sure. Because of this, weapons are
limited on spacecraft. Most military
smart guns won’t fire when turned
on a target along the outer hull of a
safe-sensor equipped ship. Civilian
weapons aren't quite so clever. Your
best bet is to keep ‘em holstered until
you’ve exhausted all other options.
Then hold on to something tight and
make for an airlock.

S U I T S  A N D  A R M O R
To protect yourself from damage and the cold
vacuum of space, you want to wear the right suit or
armor. Armor Rating is explained on page 64 and
Air Supply on page 29.
M3  PERSON N E L  A RM O R: Standard issue
for the USCMC, the M3 consists of a rigid armor
padded vest, a flexible ballistic pad that covers
the abdomen, and clamshell greaves on the lower
legs. The armor protects against edged weapons
and glancing blows from high powered ammuni-
tion. It has a built-in comm unit and Personal Data
Transmitter, combat webbing straps to connect a
variety of equipment, and contact points which
monitor the wearer’s vitals and transmit them to a
tactical monitoring station. Armor Rating 6.
IRC MK. 5 0 CO M P RE SS IO N  S U IT:  State of
the art when it was introduced six decades ago, the
reliable Mk.50 compression suit is still a common
sight on the Frontier. The sturdy helmet has a comm
unit and heads-up display, a lateral head light, and a
wireless helmet cam that syncs to any mobile or sta-
tionary monitoring system. The suit carries a healthy
supply of oxygen and maintains internal pressure
for its wearer while in a vacuum. If you are going to
get blown out into space, you want to be in a Mk.50.
Armor Rating 2, Maximum Air Supply 5.
IRC MK. 35  P RE SS U RE  S U IT:  Standard issue
for the USCMC, the Mk.35 is an unfortunately bulky
combat pressure suit with a cumbersome recycler
unit. You want to be careful wearing one of these in a
fight, as the hard joints tend to seize up with extreme
motion. While the inexpensive suit offers full protec-
tion from the vacuum of space, you have to spend
time in a decompression chamber after spacewalking
in one. Basically, this suit sucks, but if the choice is a
Mk.35 or the cold of space, shut up and suit up. Ar-
mor Rating 5, Maximum Air Supply 4. Heavy item.
ECO ALL-WO RL D  SYST E M S  S U RV IVA L
SUIT: This EVA hardsuit has fully-articulated
rotary joints and self-actuating fingers, offering
a limited range of mobility, but the maximum
amount of protection from the hazards of space.
The helmet has a sophisticated heads-up display
built in, and the suit has its own thrusters for
tether-free zero-G maneuvers. The comm array on
a standard Eco EVA Suit is unshielded, and thus
sensitive to rogue transmissions. Armor Rating 4,
Maximum Air Supply 6. Heavy item.
W E Y LA N D -Y U TA N I  A P E S U I T: The All
Purpose Environment Suit is specialized, armored
compression garb designed for combat and animal
control under adverse environmental conditions.
While an APEsuit cannot protect you from the
vacuum of space, it does offer a filtered air supply,
limited armor, resistance to temperature extremes,
and is impervious to caustic substances. The helmet
includes protective eyewear and a mask to protect

Weyland-Yutani’s security commandos and “Dog
Catcher” units to contain hostile organisms, so if

Although there are many types of computers in use
throughout the territories, there are two major master
systems in use on the Frontier.
MU/ TH/ UR: Most starships, space stations, and mili-
tary facilities are run via a sophisticated computer system
called MU/TH/UR. Originally developed by Weyland
Corporation at the end of the 21st century, the MU/TH/UR
system soon became the standard for running complex
automated systems and facilities. Affectionately nick-
named “Mother” by the crews who utilize these computers,
over the decades various models have sported different
levels of AI packages. While both the MU/TH/UR 1000 and
9000 series are sophisticated interactive models that over
time can develop rudimentary personalities, most military,
cargo, and utilitarian craft of today are equipped with the
standard 5000 through 8000 series.
While these machines can communicate through the
ship’s intercom system, most of them can only be direct-
ly accessed through the computer core. Card and punch
code entry to this secure and static free chamber is only
granted to the vessel’s commanding officer. The computer
core also allows the commanding officer to issue alternate
commands and overrides to "Mother’s" automated routine.
A . P.O. L. L.O.:  Seegson’s answer to MU/TH/UR,
A.P.O.L.L.O. was designed to coordinate Seegson’s Work-
ing Joe synthetics to run a starship. In all other regards it
is less advanced than the MU/TH/UR models.
“Mother? I’ve turned the cooling
units back on. MOTHER?”
“Ship will automatically destruct
in T-minus 5 minutes.”
“You BITCH!”
— LT.  E L L E N  R I P L E Y  V S .  M U / T H /
U R  6 0 0 0

STANDARD ACCESS
Both MU/TH/UR and A.P.O.L.L.O.
are capable of issuing reports and
updates to the entire crew, as well
as providing an analysis of any
situation upon request through
a standard terminal. A ship’s or
installation’s commanding offi-
cer and science and/or medical
officer often have better interface
privileges. Whichever system
is in use, both MU/TH/UR and
A.P.O.L.L.O.’s computing power
can be used to assist with most
mission based issues that arise.

Along with a gum wrapper and a few dirty tissues,
people always need to carry information in their
pocket. In the 22nd century, that is usually accom-
plished in the following ways:
LONG-DATA DISCS: After several data losses from
electromagnetic pulses in the first half of the 21st
century, the move was made to reintroduce and
reinforce physical data storage. Weyland Corp sci-
entists took optical disc media and enhanced it to
the next level. The result is a nano-optical long-data
memory disc. Called LDs, each disc can hold up to
10 zettabytes (ZB) of data. All colony and corporate
records are backed up on these discs in case of an
electromagnetic discharge.
MAGNETIC TAPES: A two-hundred-year-old
technology, magnetic tape cassettes have be-
come popular on the Frontier simply because
they are both disposable and cheap. Utilizing
sputter deposition technology, these cassettes
can hold between 60, 90, or 120 terabytes (TB)
of information each. While easily disrupted by a
strong magnetic pulse, the benefit of magnetic
tapes is that the archaic technology that runs
them produces no easily detected wave signals.
Most security sensor grids are set to detect
more sophisticated electronic hardware. All
these factors combined have managed to keep
magnetic tapes in vogue for the past fifty years.

COMPUTER TE R M I NA L :  A computer terminal
is any colony, starship, or station based electron-
ic hardware that can access and process data via
keyboard or voice commands and monitor, or holo-
gram. Using the right codes and COMTECH rolls at a
terminal can potentially give you access to whatever
MU/TH/UR or A.P.O.L.L.O.  knows.
PR- PUT POR TA B L E  R E M OTE  PI LOT  U P -
LINK TERM I N A L :  A military-grade armored
and water-resistant laptop, this portable terminal
has a built-in piloting joystick. With the right skills
(COMTECH roll) and access codes, you can use a
PR-PUT to patch into a colony uplink tower and
remote pilot an orbiting ship.
SEEGSON C- S E R I E S  M AGNE TI C  TA P E
RECORD ER: An “old tech” portable audio
recorder used to record or play music and audio
logs. Popular models include the classic C-24
ka-boombox and the just released portable C-60
“spacewalk-man.” Now when you go EVA you can
bring your country blues with you (MANIPULATION +1).
SAM ANI E- S E R I E S  WATC H :  A dual-faced
precision wristwatch, each Samani E-series device
is capable of telling the time and date for two
synchronized colonial locations, allowing space
travelers to keep track of time back home while
they are in deep space. The latest addition, the
E-550, includes oxygen and pressure sensors to
warn its user of a hull breach (SURVIVAL +1).
PERSONAL DATA  TRA N S M I TTE R :  These
“PDTs” transmit the recipient’s location. Some
models also monitor vital signs. Most corporate
sponsored Frontier worlds equip their colonists
with PDTs in order to keep track of them in hostile
environments. PDTs can be surgically implanted,
built into a pressure suit, or worn as an accessory.
IFF TRANSPON D E R :  A personal beacon
that prevents automated sentry systems from
accidentally blowing friendly targets to pieces.
Usually surgically implanted before a campaign,
the only flaws in the system are when their signal
is disrupted and when an enemy gets their hands
on a transceiver for infiltration purposes. How is
this accomplished if IFFs are surgically implanted?
You’d be amazed what a good sharp knife can do.
DATA  T RA N SMI T T E R  CA R DS:  DTCs are
small clear plastic data transmitter cards that plug
into a variety of recording equipment, such as
the built-in visual and audio recorders on a space
suit helmet. They wirelessly transmit data to the
terminal they are synced to. Information captured
by the device can be analyzed by a MU/TH/UR or
A.P.O.L.L.O. system or displayed on a HoloTab.
SE EG SO N  P - DAT :  A personal data tablet, a
P-DAT can be synced with Spectrograph Mapping
Devices, PDTs, and helmet cams to coordinate a
team on the go.
SE EG SO N  SYST E M DI AG N OST I C DE -
V I CE :  The SSDD is used to troubleshoot
computer and mechanical systems aboard a space
station or starship. A good engineer knows how to
use one of these to hack doors and computer ter-
minals—but you didn’t read that here (COMTECH +2).
H O LOTA B :  A high end strategic and analy-
sis platform, a HoloTab—or Holographic Display
Table—takes scanned live or recorded information
fed to it and generates a three dimensional holo-
gram of the subject. A HoloTab is usually used in
conjunction with pre-existing maps or in coordina-
tion with PDTs and Parameter Uplink Spectagraph
hardware (COMMAND and OBSERVATION +2).
MO DU L A R  CO MP U T I N G  DE V I CE :  Perfect-
ed and manufactured by Weyland Corp in the 21st
Century, a MCD is a high-end full audio/visual holo-
graphic projector. The holograms generated can fill
a 6x6m area and are completely immersive.

O PTICAL SCO P E : These come in a variety of
flavors, including laser-guided green. Increases
the range of a pistol or rifle by one category (such
as from MEDIUM to LONG or from LONG to EXTREME),
but can only be used for aimed shots. Tiny item.
BINOCULAR S :  Gives a +2 modification to OB-
SERVATION at LONG range or more when scouting
actively (not passive awareness).
M3 1 4  M OTION  T RAC KE R:  A motion-scan-
ning device, the M314 uses high-powered
ultrasonic waves to detect movement within
its sensor range (EXTREME range in open terrain,
LONG range in close quarters). Originally de-
signed for rescue teams searching for civilians
trapped in cave-ins and collapsed buildings, the
tracker soon found use by the military fighting
guerilla forces in extrasolar environments that
made infrared impractical. You need to make a
Power Supply roll after every use. Its battery has a
Power Supply level of 5 when fully charged.
M 3 1 6 M OTIO N  T RAC KE R:  The drawback to
the M314 is its size and weight—you can't fire your
weapon and operate the tracker at the same time.
An experimental pulse rifle mounted upgrade—
the M316—is currently being field tested. The
good news? It is compact, lightweight and easy to
glance at in a firefight. Of course, with good news
always comes bad. While the M316 operates about
the same as the M314, it has a much more limited
range—LONG outdoors and MEDIUM indoors. Your
results may vary, but that’s what you grunts are
for—cannon fodder to help the big corporations
figure out how to perfect their new toys. Power
Supply level 3 when fully charged.
HEAD- M OUN T E D  S IG H T:  Syncs with smart
gun or robot sentry technology to help an opera-
tor focus on and choose targets.
N E U R O  V I S O R :  A neuro visor is a helmet with
a HUD visor that allows an operator to monitor
and interface with the subconscious and dreams
of a subject in stasis. A skilled user (requires a
COMTECH roll) can also use a neurovisor to com-
municate with the hyper sleeping subject, and an
advanced user can use one to manipulate one’s
dreams—so the next time you go into hypersleep,
keep those dreams clean—your supervisor could
be watching.
W-Y  PA R A ME T E R  U P LI N K  S P E C T R O-
G R A P H  MA P P I N G  D E V I C E :  Sometimes
called “Pups,” these cost-prohibitive mapping
devices have been in use for a good hundred
years. Pups employ limited anti-gravity propul-
sion to float through, across, and over otherwise
difficult to navigate terrain. As these orbs scout
about, they constantly scan a 360-degree area
around the device with mapping lasers. The Pups
then send the spectrograph information back to
a synced device, usually a starship or ground-
based HoloTab or a monitoring station in a mobile
command vehicle. They can also detect lifeforms,
atmospheric conditions, toxins, and more. Pups
were given their nickname because they emit a
haunting, hound-like howling sound as they seek
and scan. They can scan one zone per Round, and
detect any enemies in zones they pass. Range
EXTREME.
SE E G SO N  MI C R OV I E W- 2 0 0 0 SE :  A navi-
gational map system used on space stations, the
Microview 2000SE uses the device’s coordinates
aboard the station to determine that “You are
Here” at all times—wherever here is at the time.

PERSONAL MEDKIT: A Personal Medkit contains
what you need to stop bleeding, disinfect a
wound and cauterize it, some Pharmax bandag-
es to wrap it up and a stim boost to keep you on
your feet. A Medkit is not a permanent solution,
it’s more of a band aid to keep your guts from
spilling out until you reach an Auto–Doc. Gives a
+2 modification to MEDICAL AID rolls, but can only
be used once.
SURGICAL KIT: These nasty-looking instruments
can mean life or death—in either the hands of a
surgeon or a killer. While they are intended to
save lives, in a pinch they can make for great
cutting weapons. Gives a +1 modification to MEDI-
CAL AID rolls to prevent death from a fatal critical
injury (see page 65). Base Damage 2 when used
as a weapon.
PAULING MEDPOD: If you are going to get
nearly dead, do it near a Pauling. The answer
to space medicine, the Pauling MedPod is an
autonomous medical scanner and surgical
unit capable of performing bypass surgery.
The Pauling MedPod can diagnose and treat
infections through concentrated antibiotic
injections. It can perform basic wound repair
and pre-programmed surgical procedures such
as an appendectomy, laparoscopic ablation and
cesarean section.
The Pauling MedPod has gone through sev-
eral iterations. The newest model is the Pauling
MedPod 1080i. Although still cost prohibitive,
the 1080i is much more prolific than its 720i
predecessor. All models of the Pauling MedPod
feature an airtight operating shield, comfort-
able limb restraints, a laser scalpel, computer
controlled robotic surgical arms, liquid spray an-
esthetic and vital signs sensors, all mounted on
an adjustable titanium base. The MedPod can be
programmed with a simple (+2) COMTECH roll and
has a MEDICAL AID skill level of 10 (roll for the skill
level only), but can’t push its rolls.
AUTODOC: Not everyone can afford a Pauling
MedPod, but almost every ship, station, and
colony has at least one AutoDoc. Essentially a
poor man’s version of a Pauling, the AutoDoc
is an automated medical treatment device that
diagnoses and treats lesser wounds and infec-
tions. It is not capable of complicated surgery,
but it can reset broken bones. The AutoDoc can
be programmed with an unmodified COMTECH roll
and has a MEDICAL AID skill level of 6 (but can’t
push its rolls).

P H A R M A C E U T I C A L S
There are a number of prescribed and under the
table drugs that are common on the Frontier.
NEVERSLE E P  P IL L S :  Fast acting supplement
that keeps you going well past your bedtime. Ex-
cessive use can cause stroke or heart attack. Each
dose increases your STRESS LEVEL one step but re-
moves the need for sleep for one day. During that
day, you cannot relieve stress (see page 70).
HYDR8 TIO N : An electrolyte solution that
counteracts the dehydrating effects of hypersleep,
Hydr8tion is one of the few pharmaceuticals of the
space age with no side effects.
NAPROLEVE :  An injectable instant pain
reliever for all strains, stresses, and irritations.
Recommended for use during any self-inflicted
cesarean performed to extract an unconventional
fetus from your womb. Immediately reduces the
patient’s STRESS LEVEL to zero. Warning: an over-
dose of Naproleve can have an intoxicating effect.
Each dose beyond the first in the same Shift gives
a –1 modification to all AGILITY-based skill rolls
until the end of the Shift.
R E C R E AT I O N A L D R U G S :  Get ‘recked.
Cannabis, tobacco, and certain doses of steroids,
benzodiazepines and methylenedioxymetham-
phetamine are all legal drugs prescribed for
recreational use by corporate physicians. Price
varies from $5 for a pack of cigarettes to $60,000
for a kilo of benzoylecgonine.
X- D R U G S :  These are the more extreme drugs
out there that most ethical corporations work
to keep off their colonies. These X-drugs in-
crease strength, endurance, and the senses, but
prolonged use can result in severe side effects
such as hallucinations, seizures, psychosis, and
stroke. The Colonial Marine Corps is rumored to
be experimenting with new powerful X-Stims for
its soldiers, and some unscrupulous companies
quietly supply their workers with similar illegal
stimulants in an effort to increase productivity.
Effects and prices vary.

PREFAB M E A L S : The average meal in space
is pre-prepped flash-frozen rations. Typical
meals aboard a starship include pastas, cereals,
freeze-dried vegetables, stews, meatloaf and
something resembling cornbread. Corporations
make their employees pay for these prefab
meals, despite the fact that there are few, if any,
other choices and the workers are in space on
company time. Increases your Food Supply one
step (see page 29).
WATER: Shipboard company supplied water
($2) is rationed, cloudy, recycled, and tastes
metallic, but gets you through the day. Bottles
of purified water ($10) are luxury items on some
worlds, and can fetch as much as $100/bottle on
a barren rock. Increases your Water Supply one
step (see page 29).
“BUG JUICE” PROTEIN DRINK: Commonly re-
ferred to as “bug juice,” this high protein caloric
drink is made from mealworms, roaches, bee-
tles, and other insects all raised on bug farms.
Made by a large variety of manufacturers, it is
a cheap and cost-effective way of keeping alive
on the Frontier. Increases both your Food and
Water Supply one step.
SODA AND  C A N DY  B A RS :  Luxury items on
the Frontier, these guilty pleasures can give you
a sugar rush if you need it. Increases your Food
Supply one step.
CO F F E E :  Coffee is supplied on most company
ships and stations free of charge for the crew.
Grown in Guatemala on Earth, Weyland-Yutani
coffee is the highest rated in the territories, and
free coffee is considered one of the perks of W-Y
employment. If you are on the verge of dozing off,
coffee can give you a caffeine boost to get you
through the morning. Increases your STRESS LEVEL
one step, but temporarily postpones the draw-
backs from lack of sleep for one Shift.
CO LO N Y  S P E C I A LT Y  ME A LS:  Planetside
colony grub can be a better thing, as colonists get
creative with their rations to create new “culinary
delights.” Some colonies grow their own livestock
while others have access to edible indigenous
wildlife, creating a wide variety of cuisine ranging
from Terraform 3’s bovine burgers and steaks to
boiled Tanakan scorpion thorax to kelp salad and
sushi from Bracken’s World. Increases your Food
Supply and reduces STRESS LEVEL one step.
B E E R  A N D  B O OZE :  These items are covered
under entertainment in Chapter 7. Each drink de-
creases your STRESS LEVEL one step, but also gives
you a –1 modification to all WITS-based skills for the
next Shift.  ■
